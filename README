Use the script in the following manner:

./random_writer <text file> <order>

Paramerters:

text files: Just a plain text file. Works better on longer inputs

order: The higher the order the more "sense" it will make since the following character depends on a higher number of characers, however when choosing a high order make sure you have a sufficient text file (high orders don't work well on small text files).

There are two sample files supplied, nytimes_content and nytimes_content_tech. nytimes_content is all the homepage articles from the nytimes and the other is all the articles from the nytimes technology section.
