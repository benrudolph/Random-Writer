Regulators in the United States and overseas are cracking down on computerized high-speed trading that crowds today’s stock exchanges, worried that as it spreads around the globe it is making market swings worse.        
 The cost of these high-frequency traders, critics say, is the confidence of ordinary investors in the markets, and ultimately their belief in the fairness of the financial system.        
 “There is something unholy about them,” said Guy P. Wyser-Pratte, a prominent longtime Wall Street trader and investor. “That is what caused this tremendous volatility. They make a fortune whereas the public gets so whipsawed by this trading.”        
 Regulators are playing catch-up. In the United States and Europe, they have recently fined traders for using computers to gain advantage over slower investors by illegally manipulating prices, and they suspect other market abuse could be going on. Regulators are also weighing new rules for high-speed trading, with an international regulatory body to make recommendations in coming weeks.        
 In addition, officials in Europe, Canada and the United States are considering imposing fees aimed at limiting trading volume or paying for the cost of greater oversight.        
 Perhaps regulators’ biggest worry is over the unknown dynamics of the computerized stock market world that the firms are part of — and the risk that at any moment it could spin out of control. Some regulators fear that the sudden market dive on May 6, 2010, when prices dropped by 700 points in minutes and recovered just as abruptly, was a warning of the potential problems to come. Just last week, the broader market fell throughout Tuesday’s session before shooting up 4 percent in the last hour, raising questions on what was really behind it.        
 “The flash crash was a wake-up call for the market,” said Andrew Haldane, executive director of the Bank of England responsible for financial stability. “There are many questions begging.”        
 The industry and others say that the vast majority of trading is legitimate and that its presence means many extra buyers and sellers in the markets, drastically reducing trading costs for ordinary investors.        
 James Overdahl, an adviser to the firms’ trade group, said that they favor policing the market to stamp out manipulation and that they support efforts to improve market stability. The traders, he said, “are as much interested in improving the quality of markets as anyone else.”        
 Some academic studies show that high-frequency trading tends to reduce price volatility on normal trading days.        
 And while a recent analysis by The New York Times of price changes in the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index over the past five decades showed that big price swings are more common than they used to be, analysts ascribe this to a variety of causes — including high-speed electronic trading but also high anxiety about the European crisis and the United States economy.        
 “We are just beginning to catch up to the reality of, ‘Hey, we are in an electronic market, what does that mean?’ ” said Adam Sussman, director of research at the Tabb Group, a markets specialist.        
 High-frequency trading took off in the middle of the last decade when regulatory reforms encouraged exchanges to switch from floor-based trading to electronic. As computers took over, daily turnover of stocks rose to 8 billion shares in the United States from about 6 billion in 2007, according to BATS Global Markets.        
 The trading, done by independent firms or on special desks inside big Wall Street banks , now accounts for two of every three stock market trades in America.        
 Such trading has expanded into other markets, including futures markets in the United States. It has also spread to stock markets around the world where for-profit exchanges are taking steps to attract their business.        
 When British regulators noticed strange price movements in a range of shares on the London Stock Exchange, they tracked them to a Canadian firm issuing thousands of computerized orders allegedly designed to mislead other investors.        
 In August, regulators fined the firm, Swift Trade, £8 million, or $13.1 million, for a technique called layering, which involves issuing and then canceling orders they never meant to carry out. The action was challenged by Swift Trade, which was dissolved last year.        
 Susanne Bergsträsser, a German regulator leading a review of high-speed trading for the International Organization of Securities Commissions , said authorities have to be alert for “market abuse that may arise as a result of technological development.”        
 The organization will present its recommendations to G-20 finance ministers this month.        
 In the United States, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority last year fined Trillium Brokerage Services, a New York firm, and some of its employees $2.3 million for layering.

 1 2 Next Page »What began as a small group of protesters expressing their grievances about economic inequities last month from a park in New York City has evolved into an online conversation that is spreading across the country on social media platforms.        
 Inspired by the populist message of the group known as Occupy Wall Street , more than 200 Facebook pages and Twitter accounts have sprung up in dozens of cities during the past week, seeking volunteers for local protests and fostering discussion about the group’s concerns.        
 Some 900 events have been set up on Meetup.com, and blog posts and photographs from all over the country are popping up on the WeArethe99Percent blog on Tumblr from people who see themselves as victims of not just a sagging economy but also economic injustice.        
 “I don’t want to be rich. I don’t want to live a lavish lifestyle,” wrote a woman on Tumblr, describing herself as a college student worried about the burden of student debt. “I’m worried. I’m scared, thinking about the future shakes me. I hope this works. I really hope this works.”        
 The online conversation has grown at the same time that street protests have taken place in several other cities last week, including Boston, Los Angeles, Chicago and Washington. A Web site, Occupy Together , is trying to aggregate the online conversations and the off-line activities.        
 “We are not coordinating anything,” said Justin Wedes, 26, a former high school science teacher from Brooklyn who helps manage one of the movement’s main Twitter accounts, @OccupyWallStNYC . “It is all grass roots. We are just trying to use it to disseminate information, tell stories, ask for donations and to give people a voice.”        
 To help get the word out about a rally at 3 p.m. Saturday in Washington Square Park, the group turned to its Facebook and Twitter accounts. “If you are one of the 99 percent, this is your meeting,” the Facebook invitation said. Nearly 700 people replied on Facebook saying that they would be there.        
 While people in New York are still dominating the conversation on Twitter, an analysis of Twitter data on Friday showed that almost half of the posts were made in other parts of the country, primarily in Los Angeles and San Francisco, Chicago and Washington, as well as Texas, Florida and Oregon, according to Trendrr , a social media analytics firm.        
 Mark Ghuneim , founder and chief executive officer of Trendrr, said the Twitter conversation was producing an average of 10,000 to 15,000 posts an hour on Friday about Occupy Wall Street, with most people sharing links from news sites, Tumblr, YouTube and Trendsmap.        
 Washington’s National Air and Space Museum was closed after demonstrators tried to enter the building with signs.        
 “This is more of a growing conversation than something massive as we have seen from hurricanes and with people passing away,” Mr. Ghuneim said. “The conversation for this has a strong and steady heartbeat that is spreading. We’re seeing the national dialogue morph into pockets of local and topic-based conversation.”        
 In Egypt, the We Are All Khaled Said Facebook page was started 10 months before the uprising last January to protest police brutality. The page had more than 400,000 members before it was used to help propel protesters into Tahrir Square. Occupy Wall Street’s Facebook page began a few weeks ago and has 138,000 members.        
 Yet it represents only a sliver of the conversation taking place on Facebook about the group’s anticorporate message. Unlike in Egypt, where people found one another on one Facebook page, geographically based Occupy Facebook pages have cropped up, reflecting the loosely organized approach of the group. These Occupy pages around the country are being used not only to echo the issues being discussed in New York about jobs, corporate greed and budget cuts, but also to talk about other problems closer to home.        
 In Tennessee, for example, there is an Occupy Tennessee Facebook page, as well as pages for Occupy Memphis , Occupy Knoxville , Occupy Clarksville , Occupy Chattanooga , Occupy Murfreesboro and Occupy Nashville , which helped get out the word about a lunchtime protest in Nashville’s Legislative Plaza on Friday that drew several hundred protesters with some bearing signs with the movement’s motto: “We are the 99 percent.”        
 The center of the movement’s media operation is in Zuccotti Park in Lower Manhattan, where several hundred people have been camping since Sept. 17. On Friday morning, operation central consisted of a few tables and chairs clustered around a generator, with a few volunteers editing video, posting updates for the group’s social media sites on laptops and staffing the live video feed for a channel called Global Revolution on Livestream.com .        
 Michael Fix, 47, a film producer who recently returned to New York from Brazil to support the group’s efforts, helps oversee three teams of volunteers who produce videos for YouTube, including a daily report, recapping the group’s activities.        
 “We try to tell stories about why we are here,” Mr. Fix said. “It helps inspire and educate people about the issues.”        
 On YouTube, at least 10,000 videos tagged “occupy wall street” have been uploaded in the past month. A video showing female protesters being fencing in and sprayed with pepper spray by the police is the most viewed of the protest, according to Matt McLernon, a spokesman for YouTube.        
 In addition to the videos posted from New York, Mr. McLernon said, videos have also been uploaded from Boston, Seattle, San Antonio and St. Louis, as well as from Oklahoma and Vermont.        
 Showing that YouTube can be used by both sides, the New York Police Department has uploaded its own videos of the protests on YouTube , including of the massive demonstration at the Brooklyn Bridge on Oct. 1 that led to 700 arrests. But the group is not relying exclusively on social media platforms or the Internet to deliver its message. The second edition of The Occupied Wall Street Journal, a four-page broadsheet, was published on Saturday.

JESUS FERGUSON and Howard Lederer (“the Professor”) did not invent online poker. They just took it to new heights — and, according to the authorities, new depths — as their company, Full Tilt Poker, became a gambling palace of the Web.        
 The poker press routinely described the two pro players as grand masters, and endlessly parsed their styles. Mr. Ferguson, whose official first name is Christopher, was the mathematically minded Ph.D.; Mr. Lederer, the strategic Kasparov of Texas Hold ’Em. As the years went by, Full Tilt became a powerhouse in the cultish world of Internet poker. By 2010, Americans were gambling $16 billion a year through such sites, according to PokerScout.com .        
 But on April 15, players in the United States went to fulltiltpoker.com and found this message: “This domain name has been seized by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.”        
 Federal authorities had blocked access to Full Tilt and two other top poker sites, Absolute Poker and PokerStars, and accused all three of money laundering and fraud. In poker circles, April 15 became known as Black Friday .        
 But Black Friday was just the start. A bigger bombshell hit on Sept. 20, when prosecutors asserted that Full Tilt was, in effect, the biggest bluff in poker. In a civil complaint, the Justice Department said certain Full Tilt executives, among them Mr. Ferguson and Mr. Lederer, had defrauded players of hundreds of millions of dollars. Full Tilt, the accusations went, was not just a poker site, but also a vast, global Ponzi scheme .        
 However this scandal plays out — Full Tilt and its executives have denied wrongdoing — the Internet poker debate is now stretching from the tables of Las Vegas to the halls of Congress. (Absolute Poker and PokerStars are reimbursing American players; PokerStars denies that it broke laws, and Absolute said it would not be appropriate to comment on the case.)        
 In a bid for legitimacy, poker sites and players are pushing for the federal government to legalize, regulate and tax online poker. Big-name casinos, sensing opportunity, have thrown their weight behind the idea. Pushing back are conservative Christian groups like Focus on the Family, which argue that such a step would put a federal seal of approval on Internet gambling, with potentially disastrous consequences.        
 Could online poker go legit? It might sound crazy, given the uncertain future of online poker in general, and of Full Tilt in particular. (The French investment firm Groupe Bernard Tapie has agreed to buy Full Tilt, provided that the site’s legal troubles are resolved). And yet Big Poker and its fans say the best way to safeguard players would be to give Washington a piece of the action. Prying the game out of the dark recesses of the Web could yield many billions of tax dollars for public coffers, these people say.        
 The push to legalize the game comes despite a federal law that tried to curtail online gambling in 2006. Banks and credit card companies are basically prohibited from processing payments from online gambling companies to individuals. But many legal experts say the law is murky, and the industry is itching to expand.        
 Whatever the qualms about online gambling — nightmare situations, real and potential, are many — Uncle Sam is leaving a lot of money on the table. Over 10 years, legal online gambling could generate $42 billion in tax revenue, according to the Congressional Committee on Taxation.        
 An estimated 1.8 million Americans played online poker last year, and some make a living at it. Because of the legal issues in the United States, online card rooms typically base their computer servers elsewhere, in places like Costa Rica or, in the case of Full Tilt, in the Channel Islands.        
 Online poker fans, including some with money frozen in accounts at Full Tilt, are among the most vocal proponents of legalization. “It’s the only industry on earth that is clamoring for the U.S. government to impose regulations,” says Bradley Cole, an online poker player in Oxford, Miss. Mr. Cole said he had about $5,000 in his Full Tilt account on Black Friday.        
 Oddly enough, Internet gambling is already legal in the nation’s capital. Earlier this year, the District of Columbia became the first jurisdiction in the United States to legalize it. Officials there said they hoped the move would bring in $13 million to $14 million a year in tax revenue. But Washington may only be the start. Several bills now working their way through the House of Representatives would give online poker the run of the country.        
 IN five-card poker, there are 2,598,960 possible hands. A four-of-a-kind is dealt once in about 4,000 hands, a royal flush once in 650,000. And yet aficionados say poker isn’t really a game of chance. Instead, they argue, it is a game of skill — of mathematical probabilities and human psychology, played with artful direction and misdirection. The answer to this one question — chance or skill? — may well set the course of the multibillion-dollar business of online poker.

 1 2 Next Page »STEVE JOBS , technologist and tastemaker of modern digital culture, described himself as a captain of product design, inspiring his teams of workers, as he once said, to go “beyond what anyone thought possible” and to do “some great work, really great work that will go down in history.”        
 And he did, time and again. Mr. Jobs did not make the technology himself; he led the teams that did, prodding, cajoling and inspiring. His track record as a business team leader is unique — as Apple ’s Macintosh, iPod , iPhone and iPad testify. In two stints at Apple, he made computers into coveted consumer goods and transformed not only product categories, like music players and cellphones, but also entire industries, like music and mobile communications.        
 Mr. Jobs even failed well. NeXT, a computer company he founded during his years in exile from Apple, was never a commercial success. But it was a technology pioneer. The World Wide Web was created on a NeXT computer, and NeXT software is the core of Apple’s operating systems today.        
 Part of Mr. Jobs’s legacy will be the lessons learned by those who worked closely with him over the years. Here are just a few:        
 DO WHATEVER IT TAKES TO DELIGHT CUSTOMERS Six weeks before the introduction of the iPhone in 2007, Mr. Jobs ordered a crucial design change. Until then, the planning for supplies, manufacturing and engineering had been based on the assumption that the smartphone’s face would be plastic, recalls Tony Fadell, a former Apple executive who led iPod and iPhone development from 2001 to 2009. Plastic is less fragile than glass, and easier to make.        
 But the plastic touch screen had a drawback. It was prone to developing scratches. Those scratches, Mr. Jobs insisted, would irritate users and be seen as a design flaw. “All the logical facts told us to go with plastic, and Steve’s instinct went the other way,” Mr. Fadell says. “It was Steve’s call — his gut.”        
 The glass choice was a challenge that seemed “nearly impossible” at the time, he says — a last-minute scramble to get supplies of specialized glass and tweak the design of the phone’s casing to reduce the chances the glass would crack when an iPhone was dropped. But with extra investment and a frenetic work regimen, the switch proved doable, despite the tight deadline.        
 The episode, Mr. Fadell says, points to a principle he took away from his years working with Mr. Jobs. “You do not cut corners and you make sure the customer gets an experience that is an absolute delight,” observes Mr. Fadell, who heads a Silicon Valley start-up company whose product has not yet been disclosed and will not compete with Apple.        
 GOOD IDEAS TAKE TIME After he was ousted from Apple, Mr. Jobs founded NeXT in 1985. It produced a powerful desktop computer, a stylish black cube, and its initial market was going to be in education. The idea was that the machine would be more than hardware and software; it would also offer content, “a universe of wisdom,” recalls Michael Hawley, a computer scientist who worked closely with Mr. Jobs at NeXT and lived part time in Mr. Jobs’s house, as Mr. Hawley shuttled between California and his post at the M.I.T. Media Lab.        
 NeXT computers, in Mr. Jobs’s vision, would marry technology and the liberal arts by including digital books, music and art. Mr. Jobs began pursuing the rights to works that could be converted to digital form. He persuaded a few publishers that because they would save the expense of paper, printing and distribution, NeXT should pay a royalty that was a fraction of the cost of a printed book. Mr. Jobs, Mr. Hawley recalled, struck a deal with the Oxford University Press for the complete works of Shakespeare for a royalty of $1 a digital copy.        
 NeXT’s foray into education fizzled; its machines were too expensive for that market. But Mr. Jobs’s concept and business model for digital media were “the instinct that was translated to Apple with the iTunes store, 99-cents-a-song pricing and all the media offerings that have followed,” Mr. Hawley says.        
 “When Steve believed in an idea, he was both passionate and patient, scratching away over the years until he got it right,” says Mr. Hawley, a scientist, concert pianist and host of the EG Conference, an annual gathering for technologists, educators and people in media and entertainment.        
 1 2 Next Page »STEVE JOBS , technologist and tastemaker of modern digital culture, described himself as a captain of product design, inspiring his teams of workers, as he once said, to go “beyond what anyone thought possible” and to do “some great work, really great work that will go down in history.”        
 And he did, time and again. Mr. Jobs did not make the technology himself; he led the teams that did, prodding, cajoling and inspiring. His track record as a business team leader is unique — as Apple ’s Macintosh, iPod , iPhone and iPad testify. In two stints at Apple, he made computers into coveted consumer goods and transformed not only product categories, like music players and cellphones, but also entire industries, like music and mobile communications.

 1 2 Next Page »IN August 1931, Thomas Alva Edison, age 84, became gravely ill with kidney problems. He recovered a little, then suffered a setback and was confined to bed at home, drifting in and out of consciousness. Newspapers issued multiple bulletins each day, reporting on signs of improvement or decline. The end came in the early morning of Oct. 18, 1931, with his family at his bedside.        
 That day, The New York Times ran nearly two-dozen articles on Edison’s life and death. Newspapers worldwide were filled with eulogies and remembrances for many days afterward. Words alone were not enough to express the nation’s grief. Heeding President Herbert Hoover’s request, many Americans briefly turned off their electric lights at 10 o’clock Eastern time on the night of Edison’s funeral.        
 The broad outpouring that has followed the death of Steve Jobs reminds me of the display of grief following Edison’s death. In both cases, their passing evoked an extraordinary public response, tributes that were greater and broader than those paid to many a head of state. Why is that?        
 Both men have fully occupied my attention at different times. I wrote a book about Mr. Jobs in 1993. I looked at his struggling endeavor to start another computer company, NeXT, after he left Apple amid a power struggle in 1985. His return to Apple in 1997 and the triumphs that would follow were not within sight. I took my snapshot of him and the company when he was at the miserable nadir of his professional life.        
 Years later, I wrote a biography of Edison, a person whom Mr. Jobs admired. When you compare the two personalities and their careers, a few similarities emerge immediately. Both had less formal schooling than most of their respective peers. Both possessed the ability to visualize projects on a grand scale. Both followed an inner voice when making decisions. And both had terrific tempers that could make their employees quake.        
 Both men worked in several product areas, but entertainment-related technology was a major portion of their product portfolios. This prompts a question: Would the public’s relationship to Edison have been essentially the same without the phonograph and without movies? Or with Mr. Jobs, if Apple had remained just Apple Computer?        
 After enjoying early success, each of them pursued a quixotic project that would occupy them for roughly 10 years — Mr. Jobs’s disappointing but enlightening NeXT odyssey and Edison’s failed attempt to build an iron ore processing business in northwestern New Jersey.        
 Edison’s misadventures in mining produced no visible change in the man. He had set out to “do something now so different and so much bigger than anything I’ve ever done before people will forget that my name ever was connected with anything electrical.” The milling machinery he designed, redesigned and redesigned again never worked as he expected. But he shrugged. Nothing could rattle his sense of omniscience in all technical fields.        
 Mr. Jobs, however, clearly learned from his experiences at NeXT about what not to do, such as driving away after short stints the talented people he had recruited. When he returned to Apple, he built an executive team that remained stable.        
 THE later careers of the two were more different than similar. Mr. Jobs was able to realize his product visions — again and again. Edison’s career was characterized by a pattern of introducing what today we would call a beta version of a product and then losing interest in it. Competitors would then swoop in and fully commercialize the idea — and profit the most from it.        
 Mr. Jobs was the far shrewder businessman, even if he never talked about wealth as a matter of personal interest. When Edison died, he left behind an estate valued at about $12 million, or about $180 million in today’s dollars. His friend Henry Ford had once joked that Edison was “the world’s greatest inventor and the world’s worst businessman.” Mr. Jobs was worth a commanding $6.5 billion.        
 Mr. Jobs was perhaps the most beloved billionaire the world has ever known. Richard Branson’s tribute captures the way people felt they could identify with Mr. Jobs’s life narrative: “So many people drew courage from Steve and related to his life story: adoptees, college dropouts, struggling entrepreneurs, ousted business leaders figuring out how to make a difference in the world, and people fighting debilitating illness. We have all been there in some way and can see a bit of ourselves in his personal and professional successes and struggles.”        
 By contrast, Edison became a victim of his own manufactured life narrative and the world’s adulation. Earlier, when Edison introduced the spring-driven phonograph in 1878, a reporter coined a nickname for him: “The Wizard of Menlo Park.” He liked — too much — playing the Wizard. He was ever ready to pontificate on any subject under the sun. Educational reform. National defense spending. The fatal effects of clothing that “pinches” the body. The relationship of diet to national destiny (“The rice-eating nations never progress...”). Much of it was ephemera or idiocy, best forgotten.        
 Steve Jobs did not waste his time or ours with similar flotsam. A rare time that he publicly stepped out of the role of chief executive and shared personal thoughts was when he delivered the commencement address at Stanford in June 2005. It was a moving meditation on his life and his — and our — mortality. It was a talk for the ages.        
 Early in Mr. Jobs’s career, journalists were wary of stepping within range of his “reality distortion field,” his perceived ability as a showman to make products seem better than they actually were. But it was Mr. Jobs’s personal reality in his later years, making the most of a life that both he and we knew would be cruelly cut short, that proved most influential in the end.        
 The public tributes to Edison in 1931 and those to Mr. Jobs 80 years later were similar, but only superficially. With Edison, the public thought of the Wizard, an outsize persona, through which it was impossible to see an actual person. But with Mr. Jobs, the tributes were to a fellow mortal, exactly our own height, just as vulnerable as we all are to the random strike of a life-ending catastrophe.

Over the last month 66,560,159 people have played the Sims Social on Facebook .        
 That is more than double the audience who tuned in for Ashton Kutcher’s recent debut on the hit sitcom “Two and a Half Men.” It is roughly twice the number of copies of “The Catcher in the Rye” sold during the last 60 years. And it is about 20 million more people than have ever purchased Pink Floyd’s 1973 classic “The Dark Side of the Moon.” 
 If you’re over 25 and haven’t had school-age children in the last decade, or ever, the Sims may not mean much to you. But plenty of others ( meaning young people and parents of elementary and middle-school children ) know all about it. They wouldn’t be surprised to hear that the Sims series has sold more than 140 million retail copies since its introduction 11 years ago. The only video game franchise that’s been more popular is Nintendo’s Mario. And now the Sims, made by Electronic Arts, has come to the world’s dominant social network, that staple of the daily lives of hundreds of millions of people around the world. I imagine that a few executives at Zynga headquarters in San Francisco are beginning to fret.        
 Zynga, of course, is the Wall Street darling that first identified and exploited the opportunity to lure millions of people into clicking on their farms and mafias every day on Facebook when they would otherwise be reading updates about the feeding habits of their ex-roommate’s infant. Zynga is the maker of what remains the No. 1 application on Facebook, CityVille.        
 But here’s the thing: the Sims Social has been skyrocketing in popularity since it went live in August. CityVille, on the other hand, has steadily lost players from its one-time high of more than 100 million last year. In danger of watching CityVille, its flagship game, cede the top spot to the Sims Social, Zynga has recently begun an aggressive series of promotions and discounts , including a deal with the pop star Enrique Iglesias . (His new video will be available early in CityVille.)        
 So how does the Sims Social, this Young Turk threatening to depose Zynga’s champion from the Facebook throne, actually play?        
 In fairness, pretty much like all the Zynga games, just dressed up in Sims mufti. As in traditional Sims games, you manage your avatar’s food, sleep, hygiene, bladder, social and entertainment needs. You build a house and furnish it. You can even harvest crops. (Sound familiar?) As with other Facebook games, the Sims Social is free to play, though it quickly encourages you to spend real money.        
 But there is one big distinction from those single-player games: in the Facebook version of the Sims you depend on an ever-widening circle of friends to advance. For example, to build a new couch you may have to ask your friends to send you wrenches (or you could pay real money). Later, if you want to expand your property, you may need even more friends to sign a petition.        
 There is a formula here. None of these big Facebook games are about developing your skill as a player. They are not about using your ingenuity and reflexes to overcome obstacles or explore interesting worlds or stories. They are about getting you to come back as many times a day as possible, to keep inviting more real-life friends to play and eventually to start spending real money directly on virtual items like cars and furniture.        
 As I’ve written before, they are business models dressed up as games . In many ways the entire genre is insidious and exploitative.        
 I used to think that was a bad thing.        
 But then I realized that what these major Facebook games are really selling is control. They are about giving you a little oasis, a patch of unreality that you can make just as perfect and ordered and neat as you like. When you are building your dream house or plantation or suburb, no one else can mess it up. No one is badgering you to change it or make it better. Not your parents, or your children, or your boss, or your boyfriend or your husband. It’s yours.        
 Surveys indicate that women broadly outnumber men on social networks and also use them more avidly. More narrowly, within social gaming, women also play much more than men .        
 It was a game industry executive who clued me in to the fact that the top social games appeal most heavily to women and girls. That’s one reason FrontierVille, which was supposed to be Zynga’s big new game last year, basically flopped ( it now has only around three million users ): the chopping-down-trees and fighting-off-bears vibe was too macho.        
 And it was a female friend who made me think that playing a game like the Sims Social is actually a bit like a sewing circle. It requires close attention to detail, you produce something of your own design and women often do it together to get away from annoying men.        
 As she put it, “Is it so different from women who sit around crocheting macramé owls?”

In a television experiment, shoppers this weekend watching HSN, the shopping network, can scan their TV screens with a smartphone to learn more about the products on display, and, HSN hopes, become more inclined to buy them.        
 The network on Friday began running so-called QR codes, patterned data squares similar to bar codes, on its high-definition channel. The codes, featured on the corner of the screen, correspond to products for sale. A scan brings the shopper to a product page on HSN’s mobile Web site or its app, where there is an easy link to the checkout page.        
 Shoppers have for some time been able to scan QR codes in magazine ads or store windows, but HSN says this is a first for television. If viewers take to the HSN experiment, which runs through Monday, the network said a scan-to-buy feature — where a scan of the onscreen QR code would put the product directly in the viewer’s shopping cart — could be next.        
 Market research shows that many people do not use QR codes, but some retailers see them as a potentially lucrative form of marketing. Brands like Ralph Lauren, Rachel Zoe and Original Penguin have begun adding icons and color to the traditionally black-and-white codes in an effort to make them more engaging and distinctive. And HSN said this weekend’s experiment was mostly about educating its viewers about the codes, so they could be used more fully in the future.        
 “I’m sure consumers are seeing these QR codes, and we’re actually going to explain to people how to download a QR reader, how to scan it,” said Jill Braff, the network’s executive vice president for digital commerce.        
 Some marketing experts are not sold on the effort. Andrew Grill, chief executive of United Kingdom operations for PeopleBrowsr, a social-marketing firm, said there were alternatives to the QR code — like a shortened URL address for a product — that would be less demanding on the shopper, television or otherwise.        
 “My fear is that it is simply too complicated for consumers to bother with,” Mr. Grill said in an e-mail. “There are multiple steps between seeing and recognizing a QR code, finding a suitable reader on an app store or Web site, installing it, then redeeming a code.”        
 The enthusiasm for the QR codes stems in part from their versatility. Unlike the grocery-store bar code, the pattern of squares can be read both vertically and horizontally , so they can be packed with a lot more information. When smartphones became ubiquitous, and free QR code-scanning apps became available, marketers began running QR codes in ads and offering something in return for a scan — exclusive photos or a prize entry.        
 Still, only 6.2 percent of mobile users in the United States scanned a QR code in June, according to the tracking firm comScore. And the type of person scanning was most likely to be young and male — great if you’re selling shaving cream or headphones, less so if it’s luxury women’s clothing.        
 Now, though, marketers are trying to make the codes more widely appealing and convenient to use.        
 At HSN, the company knew that many viewers were buying products by using the Web browser on their mobile phones rather than calling the television network. That got company officials thinking, Ms. Braff said.        
 “They are watching us on TV and using a mobile device as a faster, more convenient means of checkout,” she said. “We thought about what if we married the two — what if we allowed people to scan a QR code during a product demonstration, which would bring them directly to that product page on the mobile device?”        
 The network began the four-day experiment as part of its technology-themed weekend. HSN is running the codes only on its high-definition channel, because the resolution on the standard channel is not good enough for a scan.        
 While HSN is taking the codes to television, brands like Ralph Lauren and Rachel Zoe are making the printed codes a little better looking by adding icons and color to them.        
 “They don’t have to be ugly and generic anymore — they can be cool,” said Matt McKenna, president and founder of Red Fish Media, which has created customized QR codes for a number of brands. “I can’t allow my customers to put a black-and-white bar code that looks like digital noise on something that someone’s spending millions of dollars on to look beautiful.”        
 During New York Fashion Week , a Rachel Zoe QR code had a little platform shoe inserted into it, while a Ralph Lauren QR code that was used in store windows recently showed the company’s iconic horse-riding polo player.        
 When scanned, the Rachel Zoe code took viewers to exclusive behind-the-scenes pictures, while the Ralph Lauren code sent them to a mobile site where they could win clothes and United States Open tickets.        
 Perry Ellis began using standard QR codes about two years ago for its brands C&C California and Original Penguin, both of which go after a younger crowd, said Michelle Magallon, vice president for digital commerce at Perry Ellis International. Shoppers could scan the codes in order to receive the brands’ text messages about sales or new items.        
 In the summer, when the brands began running custom QR codes, she said, the codes started to serve another purpose: now the codes themselves were ads.        
 Still, Mr. Grill said the basic problem with the codes — they are hard to understand and to use — remained.        
 “Until technologies such as QR code readers are completely integrated into a mobile phone’s hardware, then my view is that adoption will be slow,” Mr. Grill said.        
In a television experiment, shoppers this weekend watching HSN, the shopping network, can scan their TV screens with a smartphone to learn more about the products on display, and, HSN hopes, become more inclined to buy them.        
 The network on Friday began running so-called QR codes, patterned data squares similar to bar codes, on its high-definition channel. The codes, featured on the corner of the screen, correspond to products for sale. A scan brings the shopper to a product page on HSN’s mobile Web site or its app, where there is an easy link to the checkout page.        
 Shoppers have for some time been able to scan QR codes in magazine ads or store windows, but HSN says this is a first for television. If viewers take to the HSN experiment, which runs through Monday, the network said a scan-to-buy feature — where a scan of the onscreen QR code would put the product directly in the viewer’s shopping cart — could be next.        
 Market research shows that many people do not use QR codes, but some retailers see them as a potentially lucrative form of marketing. Brands like Ralph Lauren, Rachel Zoe and Original Penguin have begun adding icons and color to the traditionally black-and-white codes in an effort to make them more engaging and distinctive. And HSN said this weekend’s experiment was mostly about educating its viewers about the codes, so they could be used more fully in the future.        
 “I’m sure consumers are seeing these QR codes, and we’re actually going to explain to people how to download a QR reader, how to scan it,” said Jill Braff, the network’s executive vice president for digital commerce.

The struggling wireless carrier Sprint Nextel said Friday that it would need to raise additional money to build a higher-speed data network, a move that sent its stock down 20 percent.        
 Sprint also said it would stop selling phones and other devices compatible with Clearwire’s current network at the end of next year, after it switches on its own higher-speed, fourth-generation data network.        
 Shares of Clearwire fell 32 percent after Sprint disclosed details of its new network. Sprint is Clearwire’s largest customer and majority owner, but does not control it.        
 On Tuesday, Sprint’s stock was buoyed by the news that it would carry the new iPhone 4S as investors hoped that the phone would help the company recruit and keep customers. AT&T and Verizon Wireless have been able to lure people with the iPhone, which Sprint was not able to offer until now.        
 Sprint started taking pre-orders for the iPhone 4S on Friday.        
 But Sprint also failed to offer earnings guidance that incorporated the effect of the iPhone. At an event for investors and analysts in New York on Friday, its chief executive, Dan Hesse, said that the iPhone would over time “be one of our most profitable devices,” but he did not elaborate.        
 Sprint will pay Apple dearly for the privilege of selling the phone. An iPhone that Sprint sells for $200 with a two-year contract costs $600 or so wholesale from Apple.        
 Like other carriers, Sprint has to count on making up the difference over time through service fees.        
 Analysts were looking for some clarity on Sprint’s estimates, and were frustrated.        
 After rising as high as $3.39, Sprint’s stock fell 60 cents to close at $2.41. Clearwire’s stock fell 66 cents to $1.39. Earlier in the day, the shares revisited an all-time low of $1.32 hit in August.        
BERLIN — The European Commission on Friday approved Microsoft ’s $8.5 billion purchase of Skype , saying it had no objections to a deal that would link the world’s largest software maker with the leading Internet communications service.        
 While the assent from the European competition commissioner, Joaquín Almunia, is not the final antitrust hurdle for the transaction — regulators in Russia, Ukraine, Serbia and Taiwan are still deliberating — the positive review from Brussels was considered the last significant threat to what would be Microsoft’s largest takeover to date.        
 The U.S. Federal Trade Commission approved the transaction in June.        
 In voicing no objections to the deal, Mr. Almunia, a Spanish economist, chose not to act on a complaint from an Italian competitor to Skype, Messagenet of Milan, which had asked that the deal be blocked unless Microsoft opened Skype’s 124-million user network to competitors.        
 Mr. Almunia in February approved Microsoft’s purchase of the search advertising business of Yahoo. This time, the competition commissioner said he was approving the purchase of Skype “because the deal would not significantly impede effective competition,” according to a statement by his office.        
 In the consumer communications business, the commission said Microsoft and Skype overlapped only in video communications, which Microsoft offers separately through its Windows Live Messenger program.        
 “However, the commission considers that there are no competition concerns in this growing market where numerous players, including Google, are present,” the commission said in its statement.        
 In the sale of Internet communications to businesses, Skype had only “a limited presence,” the commission concluded, which did not overlap with Microsoft’s Lync Internet communications software, used by large companies.        
 Microsoft, in a statement, called the European approval “an important milestone. We look forward to completing the final steps needed to close the acquisition.”        
 The approval from Brussels will expedite the fusion of Microsoft, maker of the ubiquitous Windows computer operating system and Office business application suite, with Skype, an Internet seller of free and low-cost audio and video telephony founded in 2003 by Niklas Zennstrom, a Swede, and Janus Friis of Denmark.        
 During the past eight years, Skype has become the largest provider of Internet-based communications. But profitability has remained elusive.        
 A previous owner, eBay, which bought Skype for an estimated $2.6 billion in October 2005, was not able to integrate Skype profitably into its online auction business. In October 2007, eBay took a $1.4 billion impairment charge reflecting what it estimated that it had overpaid for Skype.        
 Last November, eBay sold a 70 percent stake in Skype to an investor group led by Silver Lake Partners for an estimated $2 billion.        
 Microsoft, which announced its agreement to buy Skype on May 10, is paying nearly three times Skype’s market value, as measured by the sale of eBay’s stake almost a year ago to private investors.        
 Leif-Olof Wallin, an analyst in Stockholm for Gartner, said Microsoft would use Skype to bolster its push into Internet-based telephony around its Lync software for businesses. With Skype’s huge user base, Microsoft will be able to greatly expand the availability of low-cost Internet telephony, Mr. Wallin said.        
 He added that Microsoft’s distribution of Skype through its Windows operating system would improve the image of Internet calling, especially among businesses, which are increasingly encouraging workers to use their own computers and software for company business.        
 That will make Microsoft more of a direct competitive threat to Cisco Systems and Avaya, the two biggest companies that sell Internet-based telephone service software for businesses.        
 But it will also accelerate downward pressure on long-distance and international calling prices, Mr. Wallin said.        
 “Once it is preloaded on a device, whether it is a computer or a phone, it becomes more convenient to use,” Mr. Wallin said. “That will make consumers more likely to discover and try it.”        
 Whether Microsoft can generate a profit from Skype, or create profitable synergies with its other software services and products remains unclear, said David W. Cearley, an analyst for Gartner in Stamford, Connecticut.        
 “I do not believe that direct revenue was the main reason for the purchase,” Mr. Cearley said. “The main thing that Microsoft is buying with Skype is brand presence on the Web and a customer base.”        
LOS ANGELES (AP) — Sony Corp.'s movie studio is in final talks to acquire the movie rights to the highly anticipated authorized biography of Apple Inc. co-founder Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson.        
 According to a person familiar with the matter, the studio is negotiating to pay about $1 million for the rights to the project.        
 The person declined to be identified because the deal has not been finalized.        
 Sony was also behind the Oscar-winning biopic "The Social Network," about Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, and "This Is It," a documentary made of concert rehearsal footage of pop star Michael Jackson.        
 The news was earlier reported by Hollywood blog Deadline.com .        
 After Jobs' death on Wednesday, publisher Simon & Schuster pushed up the release date on Isaacson's "Steve Jobs" by a month to Oct. 24.        
 Large numbers of pre-orders of the digital e-book for $16.99 pushed the title to No. 1 on Apple's iTunes store and No. 2 on Amazon.com . Pre-orders of the hard cover copy, for $17.88, put the book at No. 1 on Amazon.        
Over the last few months, a steady stream of visitors to Palo Alto, Calif., called an old friend’s home number and asked if he was well enough to entertain visitors, perhaps for the last time.        
 In February, Steven P. Jobs had learned that, after years of fighting cancer, his time was becoming shorter. He quietly told a few acquaintances, and they, in turn, whispered to others. And so a pilgrimage began.        
 The calls trickled in at first. Just a few, then dozens, and in recent weeks, a nearly endless stream of people who wanted a few moments to say goodbye, according to people close to Mr. Jobs. Most were intercepted by his wife, Laurene. She would apologetically explain that he was too tired to receive many visitors. In his final weeks, he became so weak that it was hard for him to walk up the stairs of his own home anymore, she confided to one caller.        
 Some asked if they might try again tomorrow.        
 Sorry, she replied. He had only so much energy for farewells. The man who valued his privacy almost as much as his ability to leave his mark on the world had decided whom he most needed to see before he left.        
 Mr. Jobs spent his final weeks — as he had spent most of his life — in tight control of his choices. He invited a close friend, the physician Dean Ornish, a preventive health advocate, to join him for sushi at one of his favorite restaurants, Jin Sho in Palo Alto. He said goodbye to longtime colleagues including the venture capitalist John Doerr, the Apple board member Bill Campbell and the Disney chief executive Robert A. Iger. He offered Apple’s executives advice on unveiling the iPhone 4S, which occurred on Tuesday. He spoke to his biographer, Walter Isaacson. He started a new drug regime, and told some friends that there was reason for hope.        
 But, mostly, he spent time with his wife and children — who will now oversee a fortune of at least $6.5 billion, and, in addition to their grief, take on responsibility for tending to the legacy of someone who was as much a symbol as a man.        
 “Steve made choices,” Dr. Ornish said. “I once asked him if he was glad that he had kids, and he said, ‘It’s 10,000 times better than anything I’ve ever done.’ ”        
 “But for Steve, it was all about living life on his own terms and not wasting a moment with things he didn’t think were important. He was aware that his time on earth was limited. He wanted control of what he did with the choices that were left.”        
 In his final months, Mr. Jobs’s home — a large and comfortable but relatively modest brick house in a residential neighborhood — was surrounded by security guards. His driveway’s gate was flanked by two black S.U.V.’s.        
 On Thursday, as online eulogies multiplied and the walls of Apple stores in Taiwan, New York, Shanghai and Frankfurt were papered with hand-drawn cards, the S.U.V.’s were removed and the sidewalk at his home became a garland of bouquets, candles and a pile of apples, each with one bite carefully removed.        
 “Everyone always wanted a piece of Steve,” said one acquaintance who, in Mr. Jobs’s final weeks, was rebuffed when he sought an opportunity to say goodbye. “He created all these layers to protect himself from the fan boys and other peoples’ expectations and the distractions that have destroyed so many other companies.        
 “But once you’re gone, you belong to the world.”        
 Mr. Jobs’s biographer, Mr. Isaacson, whose book will be published in two weeks, asked him why so private a man had consented to the questions of someone writing a book. “I wanted my kids to know me,” Mr. Jobs replied, Mr. Isaacson wrote Thursday in an essay on Time.com . “I wasn’t always there for them, and I wanted them to know why and to understand what I did.”        
 Because of that privacy, little is known yet of what Mr. Jobs’s heirs will do with his wealth. Unlike many prominent business people, he has never disclosed plans to give large amounts to charity. His shares in Disney, which Mr. Jobs acquired when the entertainment company purchased his animated film company, Pixar, are worth about $4.4 billion. That is double the $2.1 billion value of his shares in Apple, perhaps surprising given that he is best known for the computer company he founded.        
 Mr. Jobs’s emphasis on secrecy, say acquaintances, led him to shy away from large public donations. At one point, Mr. Jobs was asked by the Microsoft founder Bill Gates to give a majority of his wealth to philanthropy alongside a number of prominent executives like Mr. Gates and Warren E. Buffett. But Mr. Jobs declined, according to a person with direct knowledge of Mr. Jobs’s decision.

Last November, Steven P. Jobs finally achieved his long-sought goal of bringing the Beatles to iTunes. But years before he made the deal, he began working on the promotional campaign for the music, personally designing advertisements that would sit in virtual mothballs as long as necessary.        
 “He just sat them there waiting for the day,” said Roger Faxon, the chief executive of the EMI Group, the Beatles’ label. “They were beautiful ads.”        
 As the man who introduced the iPod , iPhone and iPad to the world, Mr. Jobs became a kind of folk hero of American business for his intuitive understanding of consumer sentiment and his ability to make deals with some of the most obstinate players in entertainment and media.        
 He was, according to Bono of U2 in a statement on Thursday, “one of a very small group of anarchic Americans who through technology literally invented the 21st century. We all miss the hardware software Elvis.”        
 In many ways, the Beatles agreement was the perfect distillation of Mr. Jobs’s determination — and his complete confidence — in melding technology and culture. But for the media companies at the other end of those deals, Mr. Jobs was a far more complex figure. As executives in music, film and publishing have learned, a deal with Mr. Jobs and Apple meant inclusion in one of the most important digital marketplaces on the planet, and the potential for greater sales than from any other outlet. But the deals were inevitably made on Mr. Jobs’s strict terms.        
 “Steve’s approach to the magazine industry was, ‘My way or the highway,’ ” said Jann Wenner, the founder and editor of Rolling Stone, who dealt with Apple over the magazine’s iPad edition.        
 Of all media businesses, music has had the most fraught relationship with Apple. It was the first entertainment industry to find its basic business model shaken by the Internet, when Napster in 1999 ushered in mass illegal file-sharing. ITunes was clearly the only workable solution, said one senior executive at a major label, but Mr. Jobs’s demands that songs be sold individually and all at 99 cents made the labels uncomfortable.        
 “He was a genius and he was creative, but he was also fairly imperious,” said Bill Werde, the editorial director of Billboard. “When Apple has leverage, Apple uses leverage.”        
 Stories about Mr. Jobs’s efforts to persuade the leaders of the industry to his side are legion. For years, he remained stubbornly, victoriously inflexible about matters like pricing. He personally demonstrated iTunes to figures like Bono and Jimmy Iovine, the chairman of Interscope Geffen A&M, wowing them in much the same way he did crowds of software developers and journalists at the company’s regular product introductions.        
 “We swallowed hard,” said the senior label executive, who did not want his name used because of Apple’s well-known secrecy about negotiations and contracts. “But if anybody could pull this off, Steve could.”        
 The iTunes store has sold 16 billion songs in its eight years in business. Yet for music companies, it has been a mixed blessing. Overall music sales declined 32 percent in 2010 from 2003, when the iTunes store was introduced, according to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry. Digital music, while still growing, has not made up for the money lost from CDs.        
 For many in other forms of media, however, Apple has all but saved the music labels from a far worse fate.        
 “The cautionary tale in music was not how they did business but that they waited,” said Robert W. Pittman, the chief executive of Clear Channel Communications and a former top executive at MTV and AOL. Music executives “didn’t realize that in the digital age, the consumer can get access to content in other ways that they had no control over,” he said.        
 For others, music has been an example of an industry that gave up too much control to Apple. The company faced a revolt from magazine and newspaper publishers this year when it insisted on keeping 30 percent of the money from subscriptions sold in its app ecosystem and on controlling all customer data for those transactions. With services like Google offering more favorable terms to publishers, Apple agreed to some flexibility.

It took only hours on Wednesday night for Walter Isaacson ’s forthcoming biography of Steve Jobs to shoot up the best-seller list on Amazon.com, eventually moving from No. 384 to the No. 1 spot. On Thursday morning, a book buyer at Powell’s Books in Portland, Ore., quintupled its order of the book, to 500 copies. Simon & Schuster, the publisher, said it was accelerating the publication, moving the release date to Oct. 24 from Nov. 21.        
 And by the afternoon, the publishing industry was marveling at the potential of the book, simply titled “Steve Jobs,” weeks before its release.        
 “We think it’s the biggest adult nonfiction book of the year,” said Patricia Bostelman, the vice president for marketing at Barnes & Noble, the nation’s largest book chain.        
 Mr. Isaacson will appear on “60 Minutes” closer to its release date, two people with knowledge of publicity plans for the book said. An excerpt will run in Fortune magazine after the book is published.        
 The book is currently being printed and bound, but Simon & Schuster, adopting Jobs-like secrecy, would not say how many copies it expected to print. Industry experts said it could easily sell millions of copies in print, audio and e-book editions. George W. Bush’s memoir, “Decision Points,” published last year, sold more than three million copies, considered a huge number in the industry.        
 Much of the book’s allure comes from the promise of a peek into the private life of Mr. Jobs, who died Wednesday. Mr. Jobs’s public image was tightly controlled. But in meetings with book buyers, Mr. Isaacson promised that the book would deal with personal aspects of Mr. Jobs’s life, including previously unknown stories of his childhood and adolescence, not just the story of his business career.        
 The book will also appeal to admirers of Mr. Isaacson, who has written acclaimed biographies of Benjamin Franklin and Henry Kissinger.        
 “The reason I think it’s going to be so important is that it’s not an instant book,” said Elaine Petrocelli, the owner of Book Passage, a bookstore with two outlets in the Bay Area. “This is a book that Isaacson has worked on and has his full knowledge and what he brings to a book.”        
 It will also appeal to a wide range of readers, not just those passionate about technology, Ms. Petrocelli said. “My children who are starting their careers are fascinated with him, and they’ll want to read it, and I want to read it,” she said. “I see it as a great Christmas present. I think everyone will want it.”        
 Despite some anti-Apple sentiment in Portland, Gerry Donaghy, a book buyer at Powell’s, said he expected the book to sell hundreds of copies, hardly small change at the $35 hardcover list price.        
 “There is a lot of naysaying about the ‘cult of Apple’ and whatnot, but as the major media is highlighting how he really changed consumers’ relationships with computers, technology, music and movies, I think more folks will be interested,” Mr. Donaghy said in an e-mail.        
 Interest in the book was not limited to big cities on the coasts. Jessilynn Norcross, an owner of McLean & Eakin Booksellers in Petoskey, Mich., said the store had already printed small posters to hang on the registers, gently publicizing the book. They read: “iSad :(.”        
 “If anybody wants to order, this is our way of telling them about it without being obnoxious,” she said. “You know your customers are going to want it, but you don’t want to be insensitive. It’s a sad day.”        
 Mr. Isaacson had the cooperation of Mr. Jobs, who granted more than 40 interviews over two years as he battled pancreatic cancer. Mr. Isaacson, the chief executive of the Aspen Institute, also conducted interviews with Mr. Jobs’s family members and colleagues.        
 The book was originally announced by Simon & Schuster in April, bearing the title “iSteve: The Book of Jobs,” and scheduled for a spring 2012 publication. Simon & Schuster later moved up the release date to November and changed the title to “Steve Jobs.”        
 The publisher has said that Mr. Jobs did not ask for control over the content of the book, and that Mr. Jobs spoke “candidly, sometimes brutally so, about the people he worked with and competed against.”        
Steven P. Jobs , the visionary co-founder of Apple who helped usher in the era of personal computers and then led a cultural transformation in the way music, movies and mobile communications were experienced in the digital age, died Wednesday. He was 56.        
 The death was announced by Apple, the company Mr. Jobs and his high school friend Stephen Wozniak started in 1976 in a suburban California garage. A friend of the family said the cause was complications of pancreatic cancer.        
 Mr. Jobs had waged a long and public struggle with the disease, remaining the face of the company even as he underwent treatment, introducing new products for a global market in his trademark blue jeans even as he grew gaunt and frail.        
 He underwent surgery in 2004, received a liver transplant in 2009 and took three medical leaves of absence as Apple’s chief executive before stepping down in August and turning over the helm to Timothy D. Cook, the chief operating officer. When he left, he was still engaged in the company’s affairs, negotiating with another Silicon Valley executive only weeks earlier.        
 “I have always said that if there ever came a day when I could no longer meet my duties and expectations as Apple’s C.E.O., I would be the first to let you know,” Mr. Jobs said in a letter released by the company. “Unfortunately, that day has come.”        
 By then, having mastered digital technology and capitalized on his intuitive marketing sense, Mr. Jobs had largely come to define the personal computer industry and an array of digital consumer and entertainment businesses centered on the Internet. He had also become a very rich man, worth an estimated $8.3 billion.        
 Tributes to Mr. Jobs flowed quickly on Wednesday evening, in formal statements and in the flow of social networks, with President Obama, technology industry leaders and legions of Apple fans weighing in.        
 “For those of us lucky enough to get to work with Steve, it’s been an insanely great honor,” said Bill Gates, the Microsoft co-founder. “I will miss Steve immensely.”        
 A Twitter user named Matt Galligan wrote: “R.I.P. Steve Jobs. You touched an ugly world of technology and made it beautiful.”        
 Eight years after founding Apple, Mr. Jobs led the team that designed the Macintosh computer, a breakthrough in making personal computers easier to use. After a 12-year separation from the company, prompted by a bitter falling-out with his chief executive, John Sculley, he returned in 1997 to oversee the creation of one innovative digital device after another — the iPod , the iPhone and the iPad . These transformed not only product categories like music players and cellphones but also entire industries, like music and mobile communications.        
 During his years outside Apple, he bought a tiny computer graphics spinoff from the director George Lucas and built a team of computer scientists, artists and animators that became Pixar Animation Studios.        
 Starting with “Toy Story” in 1995, Pixar produced a string of hit movies, won several Academy Awards for artistic and technological excellence, and made the full-length computer-animated film a mainstream art form enjoyed by children and adults worldwide.        
 Mr. Jobs was neither a hardware engineer nor a software programmer, nor did he think of himself as a manager. He considered himself a technology leader, choosing the best people possible, encouraging and prodding them, and making the final call on product design.        
 It was an executive style that had evolved. In his early years at Apple, his meddling in tiny details maddened colleagues, and his criticism could be caustic and even humiliating. But he grew to elicit extraordinary loyalty.        
 “He was the most passionate leader one could hope for, a motivating force without parallel,” wrote Steven Levy, author of the 1994 book “Insanely Great,” which chronicles the creation of the Mac. “Tom Sawyer could have picked up tricks from Steve Jobs.”        
 “Toy Story,” for example, took four years to make while Pixar struggled, yet Mr. Jobs never let up on his colleagues. “‘You need a lot more than vision — you need a stubbornness, tenacity, belief and patience to stay the course,” said Edwin Catmull, a computer scientist and a co-founder of Pixar. “In Steve’s case, he pushes right to the edge, to try to make the next big step forward.”

 Correction: October 7, 2011 
 An obituary on Thursday about Steven P. Jobs, the co-founder of Apple, misidentified, in some editions and at one point, the city in California where he went to high school. It is Cupertino, not Los Altos.
 
Heard of Apple TV? A lot of people have not. That is because even though Steven P. Jobs helped upend so many businesses with a string of groundbreaking products in music, mobile phones, games and tablet computers, he barely made a dent in television.        
 Under Mr. Jobs, Apple dipped its toe only slightly into the television business with Apple TV, a set-top box for accessing Internet video. That product has been one of the rare disappointments in its lineup, especially when compared with smashes like the iPhone and iPad .        
 But many in the tech industry contend that television is ripe for technological makeover, and that the next big challenge for Apple, after the death of Mr. Jobs, is likely to be in that area.        
 “It’s the big area they haven’t colonized,” said James McQuivey, an analyst at Forrester Research. “It’s the thing we spend more of our time on than sleep."         
 In the meantime, companies like Microsoft have started to take a stronger leadership role in helping to push the technology of television forward, as Apple did in areas like music and mobile phones.        
 Television is such a tantalizing target in part because people spend so many hours watching it, but also because the industry over all has been slow to innovate except perhaps in making screens larger. In particular, the consuming public is still waiting for television content — everything that people watch — to be delivered over the Internet in a convenient, affordable package on all the devices people are now using.        
 One big reason for Apple’s failure to gain traction in television is that Apple TV has not had a compelling source of television and movie content that allows the product to stand out. Although the company’s iTunes store is stocked with many popular shows like “Glee” and “Sons of Anarchy,” network and movie studio executives have hesitated to make all of their content widely available at attractive prices, in large part over concerns about angering cable companies, a big source of their revenue, and their pipeline into living rooms.        
 In August, Apple discontinued an iTunes rental service that allowed viewers to rent television episodes for 99 cents through the store for watching on devices like Apple TV, saying that consumers were not as interested in renting episodes as in buying them.        
 Last year, talks between Apple and television executives, including NBCUniversal, Viacom and Discovery, stalled over a plan to license their programs for an Internet subscription service akin to Netflix and Hulu Plus, according to executives briefed on talks.        
 The cold shoulder to Apple from television executives is a stark contrast to the success Mr. Jobs had in wooing the music companies when the iTunes Store was begun eight years ago. At the time, Mr. Jobs used his personal charisma to persuade record executives to let Apple sell songs for 99 cents each through iTunes. It also helped him that the iPod hadn’t yet turned into a blockbuster product.        
 The subsequent explosion in sales of 99-cent digital singles on iTunes further eroded compact disc sales, many music executives say. Television executives were determined to avoid the same experience. “It didn’t work in TV and movies precisely because it did in music,” said Mr. McQuivey of Forrester Research.        
 Mr. Jobs himself often downplayed Apple TV’s impact on the market. While he used lofty words like “magical” to describe the iPad, Mr. Jobs on more than one occasion referred to the $99 Apple TV as a “hobby” for Apple because of its lackluster sales. Analysts estimate the company has sold about two million of the devices. It has sold nearly 29 million iPads since the product was introduced in the spring of 2010.        
 In an on-stage interview last year at the D: All Things Digital conference, Mr. Jobs further expounded on his pessimism about the market by saying that it was hard to sell innovative television devices like Apple TV to consumers, when cable companies give their customers a set-top box for little or no cost upfront. “That pretty much squashes any opportunity for innovation because nobody’s willing to buy a set-top box,” he said.        
 In the meantime, one of Apple’s rivals, Microsoft, announced a major new push into the television business on Wednesday, before the announcement of Mr. Jobs’s death. The company said it was entering a partnership with nearly 40 television providers, including Bravo, Comcast, HBO and Verizon FiOS, that will allow the 35 million members of its Xbox Live online service to watch mainstream cable programming through Microsoft’s game console.

 1 2 Next Page »SAN FRANCISCO — The first time Steve Jobs ever bullied anyone was in the third grade. He and some pals “basically destroyed” the teacher, he once said.        
 For the next half-century, Mr. Jobs never let up. He chewed out subordinates and partners who failed to deliver, trashed competitors who did not measure up and told know-it-all pundits to take a hike. He had a vision of greatness that he wielded to reshape the computer, telephone and entertainment industries, and he would brook no compromise.        
 Maybe it is only the despair people feel about the stagnating American economy, but the announcement of the death of the Apple co-founder Wednesday seemed to mark the end of something: in an era of limits, Mr. Jobs was the last great tyrant.        
 Even in Silicon Valley, where corporate chieftains are frequently larger than life, and soul-enhancing technology is promised with the morning e-mail, there was no one quite like him. He used his powers to make devices that are beloved by their owners in a way that very few American products manage to achieve, especially these days.        
 “Amidst the oceans of enforced mediocrity in the bland, deflavorized culture of managed-by-committee corporate behemoths,” the entrepreneur Perry Metzger posted on his Google+ page , Mr. Jobs “showed that the real path to excellence was excellence — that you could do great things by, who would have imagined, being smart and having excellent taste and not ever settling for second best.”        
 After his death became public, there was a waterfall of emotion on Twitter and blogs. Fans gathered outside Mr. Jobs’s house in Palo Alto, Calif., and they placed candles and flowers in front of Apple stores everywhere. His house is in the center of town, easy to find and rather modest for a guy worth about $6.5 billion. He was planning another house, but even that seemed as if it would be relatively restrained for a lord of Silicon Valley.        
 Where he was unrestrained was in his work. Stories of him forcefully telling Apple employees that a product was not good enough are legion. (“You’ve baked a really lovely cake,” he told one engineer, adding that the hapless fellow had used dog feces for frosting). Make it smaller and better, he commanded. No element of design was too minor to escape his notice. (On a Mac interface: “We made the buttons on the screen look so good you’ll want to lick them.”)        
 Mr. Jobs castigated competitors, particularly Microsoft. Bill Gates’s company, which dwarfed Apple in power and wealth during the 1980s and 1990s, was not even described as second-rate; it was deemed third-rate. Worse, it was not even trying.        
 “The only problem with Microsoft is they just have no taste,” Mr. Jobs said in a typical broadside. “They have absolutely no taste. And I don’t mean that in a small way, I mean that in a big way, in the sense that they don’t think of original ideas, and they don’t bring much culture into their products.”        
 This is not the sort of unvarnished comment you ever hear the founders of Google, say, publicly expressing about Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook, or vice versa. “We’re mourning Steve because we don’t have much of his passion and directness in corporate life these days,” said Jay Elliot, a former Apple executive who has written a book about learning from Mr. Jobs’s lessons in leadership. “He wasn’t driven by the stock price.”        
 Like many big tech companies, Apple has a formidable public relations staff, but Mr. Jobs was not constrained by this either. People knew his e-mail — “ sjobs@apple.com ” — and sent him queries and complaints. He often responded, if tersely. A persistent effort by a college student complaining about her inability to get information from the famously reticent P.R. staff finally elicited a testy, “Please leave us alone.”        
 Mr. Jobs’s self-confidence could sometimes be indistinguishable from arrogance and self-aggrandizement. At an Apple Halloween party during the wild early years, he reportedly came dressed as Jesus. (In a rare tribute for a layman, Mr. Jobs’s career was celebrated Thursday on the front page of the Vatican newspaper.) But it was an arrogance tempered by faith in the power of technology to improve lives.        
 The satirical newspaper The Onion underscored this point nicely in its news story on Mr. Jobs’s death. The headline, modified here to replace an expletive, said: “Last American Who Knew What the Heck He Was Doing Dies.”        
 Funny, but it is deep in the nature of Silicon Valley to challenge such sentiments. “I don’t want to take anything away from the guy, he was brilliant and uncompromising and wonderful, but there’s a level of adulation that goes beyond what is merited,” said Tim O’Reilly, chief executive of the tech publisher O’Reilly Media. “There will be revolutions and revolutionaries to come.”

WASHINGTON — The chairman of the Federal Communications Commission on Thursday outlined a plan to transform the Universal Service Fund, an $8 billion fund that is paid for by the nation’s telephone customers and used to subsidize basic telephone service in rural areas, into one that will help expand broadband Internet service to 18 million Americans who lack high-speed access.        
 The chairman, Julius Genachowski , said the overhaul of the fund would eliminate waste and inefficiencies in a program that is outdated, unfair and not accountable to the consumers who support it through monthly assessments on their phone bills.        
 An F.C.C. official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid overshadowing the chairman’s address, said the amount that consumers paid each month to finance universal service was unlikely to fall and could increase. Phone companies are assessed a percentage of their revenue from interstate and international service, and most pass along those charges to customers. The contribution rate has more than doubled over the last decade, to 15 percent currently, up from 7 percent in 2001.        
 Telecommunications industry groups and consumer watchdog organizations offered cautious support for the plan. Though Mr. Genachowski presented an overview of a new system, he offered few details on how it would affect phone companies and broadband providers.        
 “Broadband has gone from being a luxury to being a necessity for full participation in our economy and society,” Mr. Genachowski said in a speech Thursday at the agency’s headquarters. “This plan will bring enormous benefits to individual consumers, our national economy and our global competitiveness.”        
 The plan would provide for broadband in hundreds of thousands of homes and businesses beginning next year, Mr. Genachowski said, and would cut by half the number of Americans without broadband access by 2017. “And it will put us on the path to universal broadband service by the end of the decade,” he added.        
 The plan would transform the largest component of the fund, which provides $4.5 billion annually to subsidize residential phone service in rural areas that would otherwise be uneconomical for companies to serve.        
 The money would instead go to a new Connect America Fund, providing both wired and wireless Internet access to homes, businesses and “anchor institutions” like libraries and public service organizations.        
 Subsidies for landline telephone service will be phased out as broadband is expanded, but the F.C.C. chairman said he believed that the development of Internet-based phone services like Skype would supplant traditional telephones for many consumers.        
 For the first time, the Universal Service Fund will be put on an annual budget, rather than being allowed to spend freely, Mr. Genachowski said, and competitive bidding will be used to determine which companies receive subsidies — also a first.        
 Part of the money will be used to establish a Mobility Fund, which would extend and sustain the latest generation of mobile broadband service along and around more than 100,000 miles of roadways around the country, “where millions of Americans live, work and travel,” he said.        
 Also outlined Thursday were changes to the Intercarrier Compensation program, which provides subsidies for local phone companies through an assessment on long-distance calls.        
 That system, Mr. Genachowski said, “actually discourages investment in 21st-century Internet protocol networks, because companies fear losing the subsidies they receive for connecting calls using traditional telephone technology.”        
 Details on the full plan outlined by Mr. Genachowski are being circulated to the three other F.C.C. commissioners. They can suggest revisions and amendments to shape the final regulations, which will be voted on by the commission on Oct. 27.        
 Because of the lack of details, consumer and industry groups generally said they would have to review the final plan before reacting fully to the proposals.        
 “We applaud Chairman Genachowski for his commitment to connecting all Americans to high-speed broadband,” said Walter B. McCormick Jr., president and chief executive of USTelecom, a broadband industry trade association. “While we have some concerns with what he outlined today, we appreciate that he and his fellow commissioners are looking to find the right balance that will benefit consumers, advance the public interest, accelerate broadband investment and create jobs.”        
 Parul P. Desai, policy counsel for Consumers Union, similarly supported the initiative, but she said that the F.C.C. should not allow companies to raise the rates they charge for landlines, because many seniors and lower-income households will continue to depend on that service.        
 “Broadband companies are generating huge revenues while many consumers are struggling to make ends meet,” Ms. Desai said. “The F.C.C. shouldn’t allow the industry to pay for expansion on the backs of consumers.”

 The plan would transform the largest component of the fund, which provides $4.5 billion annually to subsidize residential phone service in rural areas that would otherwise be uneconomical for companies to serve.        
 The money would instead go to a new Connect America Fund, providing both wired and wireless Internet access to homes, businesses and “anchor institutions” like libraries and public service organizations.        
 Subsidies for landline telephone service will be phased out as broadband is expanded, but the F.C.C. chairman said he believed that the development of Internet-based phone services like Skype would supplant traditional telephones for many consumers.        
 For the first time, the Universal Service Fund will be put on an annual budget, rather than being allowed to spend freely, Mr. Genachowski said, and competitive bidding will be used to determine which companies receive subsidies — also a first.        
 Part of the money will be used to establish a Mobility Fund, which would extend and sustain the latest generation of mobile broadband service along and around more than 100,000 miles of roadways around the country, “where millions of Americans live, work and travel,” he said.        
 Also outlined Thursday were changes to the Intercarrier Compensation program, which provides subsidies for local phone companies through an assessment on long-distance calls.        
 That system, Mr. Genachowski said, “actually discourages investment in 21st-century Internet protocol networks, because companies fear losing the subsidies they receive for connecting calls using traditional telephone technology.”        
 Details on the full plan outlined by Mr. Genachowski are being circulated to the three other F.C.C. commissioners. They can suggest revisions and amendments to shape the final regulations, which will be voted on by the commission on Oct. 27.        
 Because of the lack of details, consumer and industry groups generally said they would have to review the final plan before reacting fully to the proposals.        
 “We applaud Chairman Genachowski for his commitment to connecting all Americans to high-speed broadband,” said Walter B. McCormick Jr., president and chief executive of USTelecom, a broadband industry trade association. “While we have some concerns with what he outlined today, we appreciate that he and his fellow commissioners are looking to find the right balance that will benefit consumers, advance the public interest, accelerate broadband investment and create jobs.”        
 Parul P. Desai, policy counsel for Consumers Union, similarly supported the initiative, but she said that the F.C.C. should not allow companies to raise the rates they charge for landlines, because many seniors and lower-income households will continue to depend on that service.        
 “Broadband companies are generating huge revenues while many consumers are struggling to make ends meet,” Ms. Desai said. “The F.C.C. shouldn’t allow the industry to pay for expansion on the backs of consumers.”        
WASHINGTON — The White House plans to issue an executive order on Friday to replace a flawed patchwork of computer security safeguards exposed by the disclosure of hundreds of thousands of classified government documents to WikiLeaks last year.        
 The order by President Obama culminates a seven-month governmentwide review of policies and procedures involving the handling of classified information, and recommendations on how to reduce the risk of breaches.        
 The directive enshrines many stopgap fixes that the Pentagon, the State Department and the Central Intelligence Agency made immediately after the initial WikiLeaks disclosures last November. Since then, for instance, the military has disabled 87 percent of its computers to prevent people from downloading classified data onto memory sticks, CDs or DVDs.        
 The Pentagon has also developed procedures to monitor and detect suspicious behavior on classified computer systems. And the State Department stopped distributing its diplomatic cables over a classified e-mail system used by many in the military, including Pfc. Bradley E. Manning , who is accused of leaking the classified documents to WikiLeaks.        
 Computer security analysts say these safeguards, as well as others in the executive order aimed at bringing greater consistency and accountability to information sharing and protection policies, are long overdue, and lag behind what is routine in the private sector.        
 “The real surprise continues to be that relatively elementary procedures should have been in place and were not,” said Ravi Sandhu, executive director of the Institute for Cyber Security at the University of Texas at San Antonio.        
 In addition to these immediate measures, Mr. Obama’s order creates a task force led by the attorney general and the director of national intelligence to combat leaks from government workers, or what the White House calls an “insider threat.”        
 The directive also establishes a special government committee that must submit a report to the president within 90 days, and then at least once a year after that, assessing federal successes and failures in protecting classified information on government computer networks.        
 According to government prosecutors, the three big WikiLeaks document dumps were disguised as a Lady Gaga CD and smuggled out of a military intelligence office in Iraq by Private Manning. Computer security analysts say the case revealed major lapses in securing classified data in war zones.        
 Now, virtually every Defense Department computer is blocked from downloading classified information onto memory sticks or CDs, except for explicitly authorized “mission essential” exceptions.        
 The Pentagon has issued a cyber identity credential to anyone using unclassified networks and has started a similar program for personnel using classified networks. These credentials allow supervisors to track what users are working on.        
 And the military is accelerating the analysis of logs from computers on the classified networks to detect large transfers of data or the use of data that is unrelated to an individual’s job duties.        
 “It’s an additional tool to provide indicators that flag anomalous behavior, much as credit card companies monitor credit card use and a user’s profile,” said Teri Takai, the Defense Department’s chief information officer.        
 The WikiLeaks disclosure also revealed disparities in the use of security safeguards by various federal agencies and even within agencies. Under the new order, each federal agency will designate a senior official to oversee procedures for safeguarding classified data that also protect user privacy and civil liberties.        
 “As technology changes, we hope to be ahead of the curve, seeing where technology is going and being able to respond before it’s necessary,” said Patrick F. Kennedy , the under secretary for management at the State Department.        
 Despite the changes and continuing review, administration officials say the new policies and procedures are relatively untested.        
 “I don’t think we’ll ever be able to guarantee this won’t happen again, but this greatly enhances our chances of preventing it or catching it in the process,” said Monte Hawkins, the director for identity management and biometrics policy at the National Security Council.        
STEVEN P. JOBS would be an influential figure in advertising even if Apple ’s sole contribution had been the “1984” commercial that introduced the Macintosh , which pioneered the idea of big-concept, big-budget spots created especially for the Super Bowl .        
 But his achievements were more far-reaching than that, according to executives who paid tribute to him on Thursday during the fourth day of Advertising Week 2011 in New York.        
 “In a way, he was our P. T. Barnum; he was such a grand marketer,” said Jon Kamen, chairman and chief executive of @radical.media. “That showmanship is something we’re all going to miss.”        
 Bill Koenigsberg, president and chief executive of Horizon Media, said: “Steve took game-changing to the highest level it could get. He didn’t move the line; he invented the line.”        
 Manny Vidal, chief executive of the Vidal Partnership, praised Mr. Jobs as a “seducer.”        
 “Apple constantly surprised us with something we didn’t think we needed,” Mr. Vidal said, but “Now, you can’t live without it.”        
 “If you just wait for consumers to tell you what to do, you’ll never be an Apple,” he added.        
 Allen DeBevoise, chairman and chief executive of Machinima, spoke of Mr. Jobs’s rare ability to combine “the technological prowess, the design and brand focus and the scale to innovate faster.”        
 Because of the revolution fueled by Apple, Mr. DeBevoise said, marketers no longer need to think in terms of millions of households with TV sets, but can instead advertise on “a billion devices” with screens displaying video content.        
 Frank Cooper, chief consumer engagement officer of PepsiCo, prefaced his remarks with some background: “Pepsi has a history with Apple. It’s not a great one.”        
 The reference was to the question Mr. Jobs asked that helped lure John Sculley from Pepsi-Cola, where Mr. Sculley was chief executive, to become Apple’s chief executive: “Do you want to spend the rest of your life selling sugared water, or do you want a chance to change the world?”        
 Mr. Jobs also endured “a lot of failures,” Mr. Cooper said, like the Lisa personal computer, but later inspired Apple’s employees to come back with successes like the iPod , iPhone and iPad .        
 “For a packaged-goods company like Pepsi, smartphones change everything,” Mr. Cooper said, because in the past “our last point of contact” with consumers before they bought products was often media like billboards and radio.        
 Now, contact becomes “a continuing process,” he added, with options like text messages and even “augmented reality, superimposing digital content at the shelf.”        
 Michael Wolff, editorial director of Adweek, said he admired how “implacable” Mr. Jobs was in his decision not to license Apple’s software to other hardware makers. “There was not a person in the world who thought” that was the right strategy, Mr. Wolff said, but Mr. Jobs’s mantra was “I don’t waver.”        
 Apple “is so ingrained, so ubiquitous, so part of everything we do,” Mr. Wolff said, that it “probably has a generation in which it’s dominant” after Mr. Jobs’s passing.        
 As for Mr. Wolff’s own future, he said: “I have a job. I am still employed. That story may be different if you ask me or The New York Post an hour from now.”        
 That was a reference to articles in The Post, and on gawker.com , reporting that Prometheus Global Media, the owner of Adweek, has decided to replace him, a year after his hiring and six months after Adweek, an advertising trade publication, was revamped to be more focused on media coverage and styled more like a general-interest magazine.        
 “There is a discussion going on in my company over what this magazine should be,” Mr. Wolff told Richard Kirshenbaum, chairman of Kirshenbaum Bond Senecal & Partners, who moderated a question-and-answer session with Mr. Wolff.        
 One side “wants a magazine that tells a smaller story, the traditional ad trade magazine story, who’s winning what accounts,” Mr. Wolff said, adding, “I would not want to tell” that story.        
 “I hope that by doing what we do, they get comfortable with it,” Mr. Wolff said, referring to those who want to change Adweek back. On the other hand, he added, “it’s their money, and you have to be comfortable how you spend it.”        
 There were also events that did not include discussions of Mr. Jobs or Apple.        
 One was a panel, sponsored by Univision Communications, devoted to marketing to the growing ranks of Hispanic consumers who are bilingual.        
 Bernie Williams, the former New York Yankees outfielder, talked about his personal process of acculturation, which began when he left Puerto Rico to play baseball. Mr. Williams recalled how television shows like “Que Pasa USA,” a bilingual series on PBS, helped him learn English.        
 For Mr. Williams’s children, he said, the process is different: he and his wife make sure they understand Spanish and appreciate Hispanic food and culture. “But they’re American,” Mr. Williams said.        
 Advertising to bicultural Latinos is tricky for many marketers, said Tony Pace, chief marketing officer for Subway.        
 Subway has determined that “we need to seem like the same brand when we are doing Spanish-language communication,” Mr. Pace said. So the phrase “$5 Footlong,” referring to the popular sandwich, is used in commercials in Spanish as well as English.        
 At Macy’s, said Martine Reardon, executive vice president for marketing and advertising, there is an evolution of its strategy to reach the critical Hispanic shopper.        
 For example, Ms. Reardon said, Macy’s changed in-store marketing materials for Lancôme to add products and spokeswomen that appeal more to Latina customers.        
 It was a way of telling that customer, “We get it. We recognize you,” Ms. Reardon said.        
 Advertising Week 2011, which began on Monday, concludes on Friday.        
I SUSPECT that our species has been longing for “smart homes” since prehistoric times. John Q. Caveman is in one corner of his cave, about to retire after a long day of gathering (he’s never been the hunting type), and suddenly, a needling worry becomes lodged in his mind: Did he put out the fire in front of the cave? He vaguely remembers doing so, but what if he’s thinking of last night, not tonight?        
 Millennia later, we are caught in the same fix. Do you drag yourself out of bed and down two flights of stairs to check if you turned off the space heater in the basement?        
 Home automation was supposed to have solved this. For decades, technology companies and futurist magazines have teased us with visions of houses in which the lighting, temperature, TV and audio system could be controlled from a central unit. You are supposed to be able to check on that basement heater while staying snug under the blanket.        
 But while much of the necessary technology exists, easy-to-use smart-home systems have always been the province of the ultra-wealthy. Economical D.I.Y. alternatives for the rest of us, including partial home-automation devices like universal remotes for entertainment systems and devices that control appliances remotely, have largely fallen short of the home-automation dream.        
 The good news is that the prices on that other route to a smart home, customized systems installed by professionals, are slowly starting to fall. Some upper-middle-class people may already be able to afford a professionally designed setup that controls at least a complete entertainment system, or maybe one that controls a few items, like the TV, the lights, the thermostat, the door locks and, say, the coffee maker, while others may be able to afford them soon.        
 Randy Stearns, the president of Engineered Environments , a Bay Area company that sells professionally designed automation systems, showed me one of his smaller projects, the automation of an entertainment system for Bill Weeks, a retired real estate executive who lives near San Francisco.        
 Mr. Weeks’s wall-mounted TV was connected to a rack of other audiovisual equipment in a nook carved out of a nearby stairwell. There were no visible wires; all the connections were hidden behind a wall panel. Mr. Weeks could control his entire system with a single remote that had been configured to his specifications by one of Mr. Stearns’s technicians.        
 When I have tested store-bought universal remote controls, they typically get out of sync with the equipment, or lack certain crucial buttons, and inevitably I needed to reach for the original remotes to get everything under control.        
 But the remote that Mr. Stearns’s firm provided as part of Mr. Weeks’s system (URC’s MX-980 , a complex device usually sold to and configured by professional installers) did not suffer from those flaws. Its buttons and on-screen panel could be endlessly programmed to do exactly what a user wanted. When Mr. Weeks pressed “Watch DVD,” for instance, his TV and his DVD player sprang into action. It was easy to use, too. Mr. Weeks said he had never had to explain how to use the TV, not even to baby sitters or grandparents.        
 “We wanted to make it obvious for everyone who came by,” he said.        
 He had to pay for that simplicity, though. The total cost of Mr. Weeks’s configuration, including equipment and installation, was $4,600, in addition to the television, which he bought separately.        
 Mr. Weeks’s bill is representative of current prices; professionally installed smart-home systems run from a few thousand to tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars, depending on the scope of the job. But Dave Pedigo, senior director of technology for the Custom Electronic Design and Installation Association , a trade group of home theater and home automation installers, said prices for custom automation kept falling, and that one major reason was the advent of touch-screen devices like the iPhone and iPad .        
 “The onslaught of Apple and Google devices has really been changing this market,” Mr. Pedigo said.        
 To illustrate Mr. Pedigo’s point, and to give me a taste of what less-affluent homeowners might be able to enjoy in coming years, Mr. Stearns took me to a sprawling house in the Bay Area suburb of Atherton, where his firm had installed an extensive home-automation system.        
 It included more than a dozen televisions, among them a 103-inch screen in a dedicated home cinema, as well as a whole-home audio system, with speakers mounted invisibly in the ceiling. There was also an integrated lighting and climate-control system, so that the family could, say, keep tabs on the temperature in the wine cellar while working out in the home gym, on the other side of the property.

 1 2 Next Page »After nearly a week of interruptions and slowdowns that made its Web site inaccessible at times, Bank of America said Wednesday the problems stemmed from a combination of heavy traffic along with the rollout of a new computer system.        
 With nearly 30 million online banking customers and the nation’s busiest bank Web site, the failures spurred consumer anger, with account holders in some cases unable to pay bills electronically or check their balances.        
 “Our priority is delivering the speed and functionality our customers expect,” said David Owen, senior vice president and head of online and mobile banking for Bank of America. “We take this very seriously, and this has been very disappointing in terms of not meeting those expectations this week.”        
 While the site seemed to be functioning normally by Wednesday evening, Mr. Owen was not declaring victory. “We’re taking this day by day,” he said.        
 The problems first cropped up on Friday, a day after the bank, the nation’s largest, announced it would impose a new $5 a month charge for some debit cardholders. But Mr. Owen insisted the problems were not caused by hackers unhappy with the new fee or by efforts to flood the site with traffic as a protest, a strategy called a denial-of-service attack.        
 “Everything we know does not point to third-party intervention,” he said. Along with hundreds of internal analysts and technical staff, Mr. Owen said the bank had also been consulting with federal law enforcement officials and outside industry experts to get to the root of the Web troubles.        
 The problems were at their worst on Friday — the day after the $5 fee was announced — but Mr. Owen pointed to other causes like weekly paydays and federal government disbursements at the beginning of the month for the increase in visitors to the site.        
 “It’s a series of events that have converged,” Mr. Owen said. Besides the increased traffic, Mr. Owen said the company was in the middle of an effort to replace an old computer system while also offering customers new options when they used the site. The combination of factors made the problem more time-consuming to fix.        
 As the company identified and fixed individual bottlenecks, he said, other problems would spring up elsewhere, delaying the effort to get the Web site working normally again. “Sometimes, it’s as simple as fixing a box or changing a setting. But that’s not the case in this instance.”        
 The Bank of America Web site had 24.3 million unique visitors in August, according to data compiled by comScore, several million more than rivals like JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Capital One.        
Private medical data for nearly 20,000 emergency room patients at California’s prestigious Stanford Hospital were exposed to public view for nearly a year because a billing contractor’s marketing agent sent the electronic spreadsheet to a job prospect as part of a skills test, the hospital and contractors confirmed this week. The applicant then sought help by unwittingly posting the confidential data on a tutoring Web site.        
 In an e-mail sent to a victim of the breach, the billing contractor, Joe Anthony Reyna, president of Multi-Specialty Collection Services in Los Angeles, explained that his marketing vendor, Frank Corcino, had received the data directly from Stanford Hospital, converted it to a new spreadsheet and then forwarded it to a woman he was considering for a short-term job.        
 The position was with Mr. Corcino’s one-man shop, Corcino & Associates, Mr. Reyna wrote in the e-mail, which was authenticated by his lawyer, Ellyn L. Sternfield. The job applicant apparently was challenged to convert the spreadsheet — which included names, admission dates, diagnosis codes and billing charges — into a bar graph and charts, Stanford Hospital officials said.        
 Not knowing that she had been given real patient data, the applicant posted it as an attachment to a request for help on studentoffortune.com , which allows students to solicit paid assistance with their work. First posted on Sept. 9, 2010, the spreadsheet remained on the site until a patient discovered it on Aug. 22 and notified Stanford.        
 The hospital, located on the campus of Stanford University in Palo Alto, demanded that the spreadsheet be removed, and the Web site quickly complied. Pressed for time, the job prospect wound up completing the assignment herself and, in the end, did not get hired, Ms. Sternfield said.        
 Mr. Corcino, in his first public statement, attributed the breach to “a chain of mistakes which are far too easy to make when handling electronic data.”        
 When the breach was first reported by The New York Times on Sept. 8, it was not clear how the data had made it to the Web.        
 Breaches of private medical data have become distressingly commonplace, with two substantial ones disclosed in the last week alone.        
 In Orlando, officials with Florida Hospital reported that three employees had improperly combed through emergency department records of 2,252 patients, apparently to forward information about accident victims to lawyers. The employees were fired, and law enforcement officials are investigating.        
 Meanwhile, Science Applications International Corporation disclosed that computer backup tapes containing medical data for 4.9 million military patients had been stolen from an employee’s car in San Antonio. The data included Social Security numbers, clinical notes, laboratory test results and prescriptions . The company said the risk of harm was low because retrieving data from the tapes would require specialized knowledge, software and hardware.        
 The Texas breach is by far the largest since September 2009, when a new federal law began requiring disclosures of medical privacy violations involving at least 500 people. Some 330 such episodes have been tallied, including four others that affected more than one million people each.        
 Officials at the Department of Health and Human Services said the new reporting requirements had exposed deep vulnerabilities and encouraged renewed vigilance.        
 “We’re moving in the right direction in terms of a culture of compliance,” said Leon Rodriguez, director of the department’s Office for Civil Rights, which investigates medical privacy cases. “Are there still a lot of problems out there? Yeah, my sense is there are still a lot of problems.”        
 The Stanford breach was notable for the duration of public exposure, and for spotlighting the vulnerability created by a medical provider’s business relationships with outside parties.        
 Last week, lawyers filed suit in state court in Los Angeles, seeking certification as a class action and $20 million in damages from Stanford Hospital & Clinics and Multi-Specialty Collection Services, which is known as MSCS. The threat of liability set off a predictable round of finger-pointing.        
 In written responses to questions, Lisa Lapin, Stanford University’s assistant vice president for university communications, said, “MSCS bears the complete and sole responsibility for the breach.”        
 Ms. Lapin said the hospital had sent the data in encrypted form to Mr. Corcino, who requested it on behalf of MSCS to analyze a strategy for improving billing collections. She said Mr. Corcino had regularly represented himself as MSCS’s executive vice president and had been Stanford’s “primary contact” during a seven-year relationship. MSCS, a five-person firm that audits hospital accounts to maximize reimbursement, possessed the passwords to unencrypt the data, she said.

 The Texas breach is by far the largest since September 2009, when a new federal law began requiring disclosures of medical privacy violations involving at least 500 people. Some 330 such episodes have been tallied, including four others that affected more than one million people each.        
 Officials at the Department of Health and Human Services said the new reporting requirements had exposed deep vulnerabilities and encouraged renewed vigilance.        
 “We’re moving in the right direction in terms of a culture of compliance,” said Leon Rodriguez, director of the department’s Office for Civil Rights, which investigates medical privacy cases. “Are there still a lot of problems out there? Yeah, my sense is there are still a lot of problems.”        
 The Stanford breach was notable for the duration of public exposure, and for spotlighting the vulnerability created by a medical provider’s business relationships with outside parties.        
 Last week, lawyers filed suit in state court in Los Angeles, seeking certification as a class action and $20 million in damages from Stanford Hospital & Clinics and Multi-Specialty Collection Services, which is known as MSCS. The threat of liability set off a predictable round of finger-pointing.        
 In written responses to questions, Lisa Lapin, Stanford University’s assistant vice president for university communications, said, “MSCS bears the complete and sole responsibility for the breach.”        
 Ms. Lapin said the hospital had sent the data in encrypted form to Mr. Corcino, who requested it on behalf of MSCS to analyze a strategy for improving billing collections. She said Mr. Corcino had regularly represented himself as MSCS’s executive vice president and had been Stanford’s “primary contact” during a seven-year relationship. MSCS, a five-person firm that audits hospital accounts to maximize reimbursement, possessed the passwords to unencrypt the data, she said.

 Additionally, the phones’ rightful owners are often oblivious to their surroundings as they stare at their screens or press them to their ears. But a fairly typical iPhone theft on Monday in southern Queens involved an unusual reversal of roles: it was the man that the police believe to be the thief who was ambushed.        
 The victim of the iPhone theft, a 31-year-old woman, had apparently considered it likely that her iPhone would someday be stolen. So she downloaded an application to her iPhone that instructs the phone to take a picture and e-mail it to her if an incorrect password is used to unlock the iPhone’s home screen, the police said.        
 That is precisely what happened, the police said, after a man bumped into her on Liberty Avenue and took her iPhone 4 from her front right pocket. The photo, which the woman later received via e-mail, shows a young man with closely cropped hair and an earring in his left ear in a bare room, with what appears to be a skylight. The woman passed the photo on to the Police Department, which distributed the photo widely to try to identify the man.        
 The app is available online under the name iGotYa, but is not for sale through iTunes.        
In the early 1990s Compaq Computer was the technology darling of the day, and PC sales were surging. Dell was promoting its build-on-demand model, Gateway computer shipped its products in boxes with Holstein cow markings, and I.B.M. had introduced the ThinkPad with its Little Tramp marketing campaign. Apple ’s Macintosh was introduced during the 1984 Super Bowl but was considered a marginal outlier with its quirky proprietary operating system.        
 About this time I had lunch with Bill Gates, who dismissed PCs as nothing but components held together by plastic and screws manufactured on low-cost assembly lines, a commodity business with narrow profit margins. The future belonged to software and semiconductor makers like Microsoft and Intel, where the real innovation was going on.        
 This made sense to me, and as the years unfolded, Mr. Gates seemed prescient. The PC makers were mostly reduced to commodity producers; I.B.M. sold off the ThinkPad, Hewlett-Packard bought Compaq and may now abandon the business; Gateway was sold off and the brand has all but vanished. Apple nearly went under. But today, the exception is so glaring as to have stood Mr. Gates’s prediction on its head: Apple’s operating profit margins have grown (to over 33 percent), and Apple’s market capitalization of $347.3 billion this week is bigger than that of Microsoft and Intel combined.        
 Of all Steve Jobs ’s accomplishments, this, to me, remains both the simplest and the most astonishing. How did he take a commodity — to borrow from the novelist Tom Wolfe, the “veal gray” plastic boxes that once weighed so heavily on both our desks and spirits — and turn it into one of the most iconic and desirable objects on the planet?        
 “Steve Jobs and Apple never — ever — wanted to be a low-margin commodity producer,” Donald Norman, a former vice president for advanced technology at Apple and author of “Living With Complexity,” told me this week. “Even the Apple II had some charm to it. It was the first personal computer that had professional industrial designers. Before that they were designed strictly by engineers, and they were ugly. Steve was always, if not an artist, then someone who was charmed by style. He had this dream of something beautiful. If it was going to cost more, it didn’t matter. This was in his genes.”        
 Paola Antonelli, senior curator of architecture and design at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, recalled buying a 1990 Macintosh Classic and taking it back to Italy. “When I got home, I took it out of that brown, padded carrying case with the rainbow-colored Apple logo on it and put it on my desk in Milan. It was like a little pug dog looking at me. It wasn’t just something I worked with; it kept me company. It had such personality and such life.”        
 My own conversion came much later. When I came across the MacBook Air, I thought it the single most elegant technology product I’d ever encountered, and not just because it looked good. Its light weight and paper-thin design made it easy to carry while offering all the functions and keyboard of a full-size PC. Even the packaging was so beautiful that I couldn’t bring myself to discard it. Now I refer to it as my third arm and can’t imagine life without it.        
 Mr. Jobs “had an exceptional eye for design, and not just an eye, but an intelligence for design,” Ms. Antonelli said. “We don’t talk just about the looks, but how objects communicate: The specific shape, how it feels in the hand, under the fingers, how you read it in the eye and the mind. This is what Steve cared passionately about.”        
 MoMA has 25 Apple products in its permanent design collection. And like many great artists, Mr. Jobs’s near-dictatorial control of Apple made possible the pursuit of perfection. “If you’re a visionary, and a dictator, you can take risks and be consistent,” Ms. Antonelli said. “NeXT was a risk and a beautiful failure. It brought him back to Apple. The dynamics of Apple and Steve’s personality and the course of history made for this perfect alignment of the stars.”        
 Also like many artists (Frank Lloyd Wright comes to mind), Mr. Jobs was legendarily difficult at times. “He has always been focused, driven, demanding and, as a result, very difficult and abrasive,” Mr. Norman said. “This abrasiveness in the early days was too extreme and was destructive of the company. John Sculley had to fire him. When Steve came back, he had matured. He still had a demanding vision of perfection, but he brought focus. He was slightly less abrasive. He was brilliant at understanding what a product should be and he was a dictator.”

 1 2 Next Page »IN the memorials to Steven P. Jobs this week, Apple ’s co-founder was compared with the world’s great inventor-entrepreneurs: Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, Alexander Graham Bell. Yet virtually none of the obituaries mentioned the man Jobs himself considered his hero , the person on whose career he explicitly modeled his own: Edwin H. Land, the genius domus of Polaroid Corporation and inventor of instant photography.        
 Land, in his time, was nearly as visible as Jobs was in his. In 1972, he made the covers of both Time and Life magazines, probably the only chemist ever to do so. (Instant photography was a genuine phenomenon back then, and Land had created the entire medium, once joking that he’d worked out the whole idea in a few hours, then spent nearly 30 years getting those last few details down.) And the more you learn about Land, the more you realize how closely Jobs echoed him.        
 Both built multibillion-dollar corporations on inventions that were guarded by relentless patent enforcement. (That also kept the competition at bay, and the profit margins up.) Both were autodidacts, college dropouts (Land from Harvard, Jobs from Reed) who more than made up for their lapsed educations by cultivating extremely refined taste. At Polaroid, Land used to hire Smith College’s smartest art-history majors and send them off for a few science classes, in order to create chemists who could keep up when his conversation turned from Maxwell’s equations to Renoir’s brush strokes.        
 Most of all, Land believed in the power of the scientific demonstration. Starting in the 60s, he began to turn Polaroid’s shareholders’ meetings into dramatic showcases for whatever line the company was about to introduce. In a perfectly art-directed setting, sometimes with live music between segments, he would take the stage, slides projected behind him, the new product in hand, and instead of deploying snake-oil salesmanship would draw you into Land’s World. By the end of the afternoon, you probably wanted to stay there.        
 Three decades later, Jobs would do exactly the same thing, except in a black turtleneck and jeans. His admiration for Land was open and unabashed . In 1985, he told an interviewer , “The man is a national treasure. I don’t understand why people like that can’t be held up as models: This is the most incredible thing to be — not an astronaut, not a football player — but this .”        
 The two men met at least twice. John Sculley, the Apple C.E.O. who eventually clashed with Jobs, was there for one meeting, when Jobs made a pilgrimage to Land’s labs in Cambridge, Mass., and wrote in his autobiography that both men described a singular experience: “Dr. Land was saying: ‘I could see what the Polaroid camera should be. It was just as real to me as if it was sitting in front of me, before I had ever built one.’ And Steve said: ‘Yeah, that’s exactly the way I saw the Macintosh.’ He said, If I asked someone who had only used a personal calculator what a Macintosh should be like, they couldn’t have told me. There was no way to do consumer research on it, so I had to go and create it and then show it to people and say, ‘Now what do you think?’”        
 The worldview he was describing perfectly echoed Land’s: “Market research is what you do when your product isn’t any good.” And his sense of innovation: “Every significant invention,” Land once said, “must be startling, unexpected, and must come into a world that is not prepared for it. If the world were prepared for it, it would not be much of an invention.” Thirty years later, when a reporter asked Jobs how much market research Apple had done before introducing the iPad , he responded, “None. It isn’t the consumers’ job to know what they want.”        
 Land, like Jobs, was a perfectionist-aesthete, exhaustively obsessive about product design. The amount he spent on research and development, on buffing out flaws, sometimes left Wall Street analysts discouraging the purchase of Polaroid stock, because they thought the company wasn’t paying enough attention to the bottom line. (When a shareholder once buttonholed Land about that, he responded, “The bottom line is in heaven.”)        
 His supreme achievement, the folding SX-70 camera of the 1970s, was as covetable a luxury object in its moment as the iPod was 30 years later. At the touch of a hand, it collapsed down to a flat, clean pocketable prism, beautifully finished in brushed chrome and leather. One source says he spent $2 billion — and those are 1960s and early-1970s dollars — on developing the camera and its film. Jobs saw, and Jobs understood: “Not only was he one of the great inventors of our time but, more important, he saw the intersection of art and science and business and built an organization to reflect that.”        
 And Land was, like Jobs in 1985, all but forced out of the company he’d built. In the mid-’70s, Land threw himself behind a doomed project called Polavision. It was an instant 8-millimeter home-movie system, and a gorgeous bit of technology, and it also took more than a decade to get out of the labs and into stores. By the time it did, it was dead on arrival, clobbered by Sony’s burgeoning Betamax video cameras.

 1 2 Next Page »As more TV viewers watch their favorite shows online, the number of U.S. households without a cable subscription is expected to rise dramatically between now and 2016, according to a new report from Magnaglobal, a media forecasting firm.        
 By 2016, the number of households that do not subscribe to a traditional pay TV service will triple from what it is today. All told, 9 million households won't have cable, Magnaglobal predicts. Of those, about 4 million are what we'd call cord cutters; people who once subscribed to cable but canceled it in favor of accessing television content via the Internet using a set top box or computer hooked up to their TV sets.        
 Comprising an even bigger number of cable-free consumers will be those who never signed up for cable or satellite service in the first place. This group of consumers is growing. Teenagers live more and more of their lives online, where they consume most of their media, even if their parents are paying for cable subscription at home. As that generation goes away to college, there's little reason for many of them to pay up for cable TV on campus when Hulu, Netflix and a variety of competiting services await them. Once they graduate and enter the job market, cable is just not something they are likely to feel they need.        
 The number of people who never signed up for cable is expected to double - to 5 million, from 2.5 million today - by 2016, according to the report. Meanwhile, growth of DVR ownership is expected to slow down, as the devices become less necessary in light of stream-anytime Web content sitting waiting in people's video queues.        
 The cable industry, having seen this coming, is preparing its own preemptive strikes. Comcast and Verizon are rumored to be bringing cable subcriptions to Microsoft's XBox 360 , a gaming console that effectively doubles as a set-top box. Comcast has rolled out its own Web TV initiative called "TV Anywhere" that lets paying subscribers watch content from a variety of devices. They also bought a giant content company , just in case.

The Dalai Lama, Tibet's spiritual leader in exile, has joined Google Plus , and he's hosting a live Hangout tomorrow with Archbishop Desmond Tutu. The conversation is part of the inaugural Desmond Tutu Peace Lecture in Cape Town, South Africa. It's an On Air Hangout, so there's no limit to the number of viewers.        
 The Hangout will be held tomorrow (Saturday, October 8) at 10:30 a.m. South African time (GMT +2:00). Unfortunately for U.S. readers, that's 4:30 a.m. Eastern, 1:30 a.m. Pacific. Google SVP Vic Gundotra says the video will be available shortly thereafter. You can follow the Dalai Lama and Archbishop Desmond Tutu on Google Plus.        
 Greetings from His Holiness the Dalai Lama on the occasion of Archbishop Desmond Tutu's 80th birthday on October 7, 2011. 
 The Dalai Lama is unable to attend the lecture in person, because the South African government has not responded to his application for a visa multiple times. Official acknowledgement of the Dalai Lama's legitimacy is politically sensitive, since it can be perceived as an affront to China. In refusing to grant the Dalai Lama entry, the South African government may be capitulating to that pressure. The Hangout will provide the opportunity for these two global spiritual leaders to converse remotely.        
 As an exiled leader, as well as a worldwide figure, the Web is an important part of the Dalai Lama's outreach. He has maintained a Twitter presence ( @DalaiLama ) since 2010. He spoke to ecademy that year about his views on social media:        
 
 "Alongside our natural ability to empathize with others, we also have a need for others'
kindness, which runs like a thread throughout our whole life. It is most apparent when we are young and when we are old, but we have only to fall ill to be reminded how important it is to be loved and cared about, even in our prime ...years."        
 
 The 14th Dalai Lama has been in exile in India since 1959 after Tibet was annexed by China. Desmond Tutu is a South African activist and retired Anglican bishop who has been a longtime champion of human rights causes.

What makes a good advertisement? From a consumer's standpoint, a good ad is entertaining, helpful, and hopefully not too much of an interruption. Ads are a part of life for consumers, especially on the Web. In exchange for getting all this stuff for free or cheap, we accept the background noise of advertising.        
 But advertisers don't want to be in the background. They want ads to be engaging, interesting, even fun - whatever creates a lasting memory of the product. It's an attention economy, and whatever can grab users' attention wins. But touch-driven mobile apps are so immersive, advertisers need to step their game up. Palo Alto-based Cooliris has a solution, and they think the science backs it up. World, ready or not, here comes interactive, touch-controlled, 3D mobile advertising.        
 "The advertisement experience does not have to be sub-par compared to the application experience," Cooliris CEO Soujanya Bhumkar says. "Good experience matters, because that is what delivers high engagement." To deliver that experience, Cooliris has created a standalone business unit called Adjitsu to build 3D mobile ads that users can touch to move, pinch, zoom and explore products.        
 "What we wanted to do was create a new generation of ads that allowed people to decide which parts of the experience they wanted to indulge in," says Aneesh Karve, product manager at AdJitsu. "Our mantra is pretty simple. It's 'Beyond HTML5.' We think [AdJitsu ads are] the next generation, which goes beyond video and beyond HTML."        
 "Video is telling the consumer what they should look at," Karve says. "What we've tried to do with our ads is to allow the consumer to decide which part of the ad they're most interested in."        
 The Ad Is An App 
 An AdJitsu ad starts off as a small, out-of-the-way display ad, but it has a 3D model of a product, like a new smartphone, suspended inside it. The model is linked to the device's accelerometer. As the user tilts the phone or tablet he or she is using, the product tilts and turns, catching the user's attention. Ideally, the user will then tap the ad, which expands to into a full-screen, app-like experience where the user can manipulate the product using typical touchscreen gestures.        
 The advertiser can display more info about the product on the screen alongside the model, but the experience is designed around letting the user closely examine the product and kick the tires a little bit - virtually, of course.        
 Karve says these ads are especially effective for "products that consumers need to hold in their hands." It's not just for consumer electronics, but jewelry or clothing, too. "People want to see how a fabric hangs or how a material looks in a certain light, and we're uniquely capable of providing those kinds of experiences."        
 This Is Your Brain On AdJitsu 
 It's neat, it's technologically advanced, and it shows off the product better than any static or video ad can. But does it really engage users with the product? Cooliris has enlisted a neuromarketing firm called MindSign to prove that it does, and this is where things get a little... edgy.        
 MindSign is a San Diego facility that uses functional MRI to analyze consumer reactions to products and advertising. An fMRI scanner magnetically tracks hemoglobin, the iron-rich protein in the blood, as blood flows in the brain. When blood cells offload oxygen to activated brain cells, the hemoglobin's magnetic field changes, which shows up in the scan. This allows researchers to measure the level of activity in specific areas of the brain in real time.        
 Science Channel video from MindSign explaining how fMRI works: 
 MindSign did a study for Cooliris that presented one group of subjects with a Cooliris ad and another with a video ad that was the same, shot by shot, but not interactive. Using the fMRI, MindSign produced video of the subjects' brain activity as they experienced the ads. MindSign found that the passive act of watching video was the "most deactivating" experience across all subjects. The subjects who manipulated the 3D ads were lit up all over their brains, engaging motor and attention areas.        
 We're not neuroscientists at RWW, so the subtle differences between the scans might be lost on us, but one clearly defined area of difference was the ventromedial prefrontal cortex , what MindSign calls the "personal meaning area." This is a central region of the brain involved in decision making. "It's an area that activates with what I would call good, engaging content," says MindSign vice president Philip Carlsen.        
 Unfortunately, MindSign couldn't provide RWW with a shareable video that compared the control and 3D subjects side by side, but they did offer these still images that show an average activation across the whole trial. The ventromedial prefrontal cortex is mostly dark for the control group, but it's brightly colored for the group that saw the AdJitsu ads:

 Is Neuromarketing For Real? 
 Does this activation necessarily correspond to the kind of engagement advertisers want? MindSign couldn't really answer that. This is a brand new science, and MindSign admits it. "fMRI is still in an infant state as far as neuromarketing goes," says Carlsen. "Activation is compared to a baseline looking at a blank screen with a crosshair on it, so you're going to want your stimuli to be more activating than the crosshair."        
 "Whether that's good activation because they love it or bad activation because they're disgusted," Carlsen says, "that depends on the stimuli."        
 "The reporting that we do fits into the traditional marketing reports of memory retention, brand recognition, value judgments, but we can do lots more than that," MindSign president Devin Hubbard says. "You can quantify, pretty objectively, the brain reaction in these key areas that are researched and known to be caused by certain stimuli, and they react accordingly."        
 For now, it sounds like the best fMRI can do for advertisers is provide a corroborating hunch alongside traditional marketing surveys.        
 Bringing UI Into Advertising 
 "The importance of engaging MindSign was to show the brands that they could get a higher return on their investment for their dollars," Karve says. "A lot of the really deep things advertisers want to track, you can't do with just Internet cookies or tracking session data from an app. So by going to the brain data, we want to establish how this is going to really have an impact on people."        
 The brain data do look differently between the control group and the 3D ad subjects, but it's hard to make the case conclusively that this means 3D ads are really better ads . But there's no question that these AdJitsu ads make fuller use of the Web technology and hardware that users love than traditional ads do.        
 What do you think? From a user standpoint, does the opportunity to play with the ad in 3D make it more interesting to you? Share your thoughts in the comments.

Google has just announced the latest class of countries to graduate from Google Map Maker and become full-fledged citizens of Google Maps. Map Maker allows "citizen cartographers" to add details like little roads, businesses and geographic features to parts of the world that Google's staff can't easily reach.        
 Today's announcement incorporates community contributions from a bunch of new countries, territories, and even an entire continents into the live Google map. The graduates are: Afghanistan, Antarctica, Ecuador, Georgia, Guatemala, Heard Island and McDonald Islands, Honduras, Iraq, Norfolk Island, Saint Pierre & Miquelon and Saudi Arabia.        
 Kabul, Afghanistan before and after graduation 
 Google has strained under the weight of mapping the entire wold. After launching Map Maker to crowdsource the effort in 2008, it has steadily increased the importance of community contributions. In April, Google opened Map Maker in the U.S. , a tacit admission that it can't map all the locations and businesses itself, even in the world's most wired places.        
 In September, the Google LatLong team even shifted some of the Map Maker approval process onto Regional Expert Reviewers from the community, rather than having staff moderate all changes.

 The system has shown signs of strain. It took the Google Maps team two months to recognize South Sudan's independence , despite a clamoring community. But Google has pressed forward with its effort to expand the global importance of Maps. In August, 40 new countries received localized top-level domains for Google Maps.        
 As curating Maps becomes a worldwide effort, crowd contributions from Map Maker will only become more important. Today's large crop of graduates is a recognition of great work by a community of volunteers around the world.

 Congratulations to the graduates!

LinkedIn has launched status updates from companies. Administrators of company pages can post short updates just like individual users can. This provides companies with a way to engage followers and start conversations from within the public LinkedIn stream.        
 Users of LinkedIn could follow company profiles since 2010. Previously, users following a company would see personnel changes, new job openings and company profile updates. Now companies can also share 500-character messages, links and media with followers as well.        
 LinkedIn has made an effort to enhance its social features this year, opening its Groups API to developers and adding Groups to its new native mobile apps . The professional social network also set a good precedent for sharing in its first-ever public earnings call , making the slide deck embeddable for anyone and live-tweeting the call.        
 LinkedIn is moving toward becoming the human resources hub for companies on the Web, not just a place for two-way networking. In July, LinkedIn enabled employers to let job applicants apply with LinkedIn from a company's own website. Today's update adds another way for companies and professionals to interact using LinkedIn.

 Thanks to smartphones and wireless networking and SMS and Twitter, we are all swimming in an ocean of real-time information — an ocean that can often seem overwhelming. Are new technologies going to help, or are they going to increase the problem? A presentation at the recent Society for News Design conference included a video called “The Storm Collection,” whose creators imagined a near future in which real-time updates about a news event would be shown in virtual heads-up displays on picture frames, car windshields and even eyeglasses. But would this kind of technology make our information-overload problem better or worse?        
 In the video (embedded below), the two creators — Matt Thompson , editorial product manager at National Public Radio, and writer/blogger Robin Sloan , who is also part of the media partnerships team at Twitter — talk about some of the technologies we already have for getting live updates about something like a tornado hitting a small town : SMS for text messaging people, mobile media websites with official information, Instagram for sharing photos of damage, and Twitter and Facebook for talking about the event and posting status updates, pictures, videos and so on.        
 Want to watch a video from an unmanned drone? 
 What might things look like a few years from now? Among other things, Sloan and Thompson imagine photo frames that include news-related and location-based updates about the person who appears in the picture (“Sarah checked in at Tornado Safety Zone”), televisions and video terminals that show a real-time video feed from unmanned drones flying over the damaged areas, and heads-up displays embedded in car windshields and eyeglasses that give live updates about damage near the user of the device (“Downed power lines in area, please use caution”).        
 I have no doubt that the things that Sloan and Thompson are describing are close to becoming reality, if they aren’t already. And the benefits of having a photo frame that could update you about the location of the loved one in the picture in case of emergency — by using GPS or a location-based service such as Foursquare, presumably — seem pretty obvious. And if anyone likes a constant stream of real-time news and information about the world, it’s me; I am connected to Twitter almost all the time (as my family will tell you), and I use Instagram and Facebook and plenty of other social services to keep track of what friends and family are doing.        
 But I wonder whether a world like the one portrayed in “The Storm Collection” would be a positive thing for many people, and particularly those who already feel overwhelmed by the waves of information that they are already subjected to — whether it’s 24-hour TV news programs, or Twitter and Facebook, or all the other real-time sources we are all bombarded by throughout the average day.        
 The biggest issue is one that media analyst and journalism professor Clay Shirky has described, when he said the problem with the digital age isn’t so much information overload as it is “filter failure.” As Robin Sloan is no doubt aware, Twitter is a great example of this phenomenon in action: it allows you to follow the comments of hundreds of even thousands of people, as I do, but it doesn’t really provide all that many great ways of filtering that content so that it is manageable. Trending topics is one way, and lists are another, but neither of these provides a great solution.        
 How do we deal with “filter failure?” 
 Twitter isn’t alone in this; Facebook has implemented “smart lists” and now allows people to “subscribe” to others in the same way Twitter does, but in some ways this actually exaggerates the problem instead of solving it. Google+ has Circles, which allow users to create mini-groups that they can either follow or post their comments to, but many people don’t use them (just as many people don’t use Facebook or Twitter lists, which have been around for a while now). As a result, it’s still easy to become overwhelmed by the “activity stream,” whether it’s Twitter or Facebook or Google.        
 
 To come back to “The Storm Collection” example, it looks as though Sloan and Thompson see most of the real-time news updates and unmanned-drone videos and so on coming from media outlets (in this case the Fresno Bee , owned by McClatchy) . But the filtering problem exists for media companies as well; in fact, in some ways, it’s worse, because they are taking in so many other sources of content in addition to Twitter and SMS and photos. This is complicated by another phenomenon Sloan and Thompson dealt with in a 2004 video project called EPIC 2014 : the explosion of “user-generated content” or citizen journalism that blogging and other tools allow.        
 As a post from a BBC “user-generated content” editor described earlier this year, filtering and making sense of this never-ending stream of information isn’t an easy task : The UGC desk at the British broadcaster has a large staff that try to verify and “curate” news reports from Twitter and Flickr and YouTube about events such as the revolutions in Egypt. Andy Carvin of NPR has turned his personal Twitter stream into a one-man newswire of curated and verified “citizen journalism,” but even his output is so massive in some cases that it needs a second set of curators using tools like Storify to filter what he has already filtered.        
 In the presentation to the Society of News Design, Sloan said : “If the world is suddenly this new terrain full of all these new screens and all these new ways to get stories out there, [journalists] should be in the business of identifying rich new territory, sending out scouts, and seizing it.” In the end, the problem may not be identifying or seizing these new territories, but coming up with ways to prevent them from becoming just another piece of flotsam in a never-ending sea of real-time content.

Perhaps Netflix has found a friend in its lonely battle against broadband caps , as a U.K. site is reporting that gamers playing the OnLive service can use up to 20 GB in six hours. Cable.co.uk, a broadband comparison shopping site, also reports that some folks using the service have run afoul of British ISP Talk Talk’s network management policies, which meant players were unable to connect to the service at peak times. From the story :        
 
 Amid concerns that taking advantage of the service could lead broadband customers to consume substantial amounts of data, Techbeast.net conducted a trial to discover how much would be used during a typical gaming session. Playing Just Cause 2 through OnLive for around five minutes used around 200MB of data, meaning gamers can expect to get through around 20GB in as little as six hours.        
 
 Before you dismiss the plight of a few gamers across the pond, consider that now that AT&T has implemented broadband caps joining Comcast, more than 50 percent of U.S. homes have some kind of limit on their broadband connection in place. And this week, Suddenlink confirmed it, too, has started implementing caps that range from 150 GB to 350 GB per month depending on the level of service customers subscribe to. Comcast doesn’t use speed tiers to differentiate between its cap, which is set at 250 GB per month, but AT&T has a lower cap of 150 GB per month for DSL users and 250 GB per month for its faster U-verse offering.        
 So what we have are more ISPs setting caps as well as a sense of what kinds of caps they are planning to set in the U.S. It appears that at the slowest tier, we’ll see caps of about 150 GB, and those willing to pay up for faster speeds will also get higher caps. It’s unlikely we’ll see ISPs raise these caps anytime soon, especially if they can milk $10 per GB overage fees out of users.        
 But by adding gamers now to the groups of those affected by broadband caps, are we getting to a critical mass of consumers affected, so when an ISP says that less than 1 percent of their users hit those caps, folks will look around and realize that while they may not be in that 1 percent they’re getting a little too close for comfort ? The outraged gaming community can join consumers who cut the cord, remote workers , confused folks trying to back up content to the cloud and BitTorrent users in the ranks of those who have bumped up against broadband caps and found it painful.

Reports of the death of Groupon’s IPO plans have apparently been greatly exaggerated. The online daily deals pioneer filed an updated version of its S-1 document with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday, as part of its preparation for a planned initial public offering of its stock.        
 Since the company first filed its S-1 in June, Groupon has been roundly criticized for its seemingly shady accounting practices and that its early founders and investors have already cashed out billions of dollars worth of the company’s stock. CEO Andrew Mason was so irked by the negative press that he sent a long email to Groupon’s employees filled with talking points they could use to defend the company. Ironically, when that email was inevitably leaked to the press, it only attracted more criticism; the missive was seen as a violation of the SEC’s quiet period rules.        
 These issues coupled with the larger environment of economic unrest have fueled rumors that Groupon had put its stock market plans on ice . But Friday’s S-1 update — the third revision since June — shows that the company is still keen to go public. Despite Groupon’s swaggering reputation and Mason’s grumbling about haters, the company’s management is showing that underneath it all, it’s actually willing to make changes and respond to criticism. Specifically, the latest filing has a few notable tweaks: Groupon said it plans to scale back its marketing budget, reported that its revenue bookings were slightly higher in the second quarter of the year, and reprinted the full text of Mason’s leaked email.        
 More than anything, though, updating the S-1 shows that Groupon is still serious about making its stock market debut at some point soon. But ultimately, that will only happen if investors show that they have an appetite for the company’s shares.

It looked like an ordinary Friday afternoon for Chris Huhne, Britain’s secretary of state for energy and a member of the British coalition government. The day was ending. Things were wrapping up for the weekend. And then it all went haywire.        
 A mysterious message appeared on his Twitter stream: “From someone else fine,” it said. “But I do not want my fingerprints on the story C.”        
 It was rapidly deleted, but by then, of course, it was too late. Some of his 7,500 followers — some of them reporters — had picked up the message and began questioning it.        
 Was it genuine? Almost certainly: The message, obviously sent by mistake, apparently came in by text. But what was the story he was referring to? Was it a leak? Was it an attempt to undermine a rival… or even an ally? In these fractious political times, the mere hint of conspiracy was enough to send the political machine into overdrive, while Huhne himself appears to have gone silent.        
 This mini scandal will probably blow over, but the idea of a public figure being skewered by private messages let loose is far from new. Technology can accelerate leaks and slips; just ask Anthony Weiner, whose groin probably has spent as much time on the air as the man himself , or British prime minister Gordon Brown, who called a supporter “bigoted” without realizing his microphone was still on .        
 But these leaks have always happened whenever somebody fails to control their message or the people around them. Just look at the famous Zimmerman telegram , which hastened America’s entry into the First World War.        
 Some argue that these slips — in the long run — are no bad thing, since everything should happen in public. In a way, the “frictionless sharing” Facebook has championed is a euphemism for precisely that. And it’s an idea that media critic Jeff Jarvis argues forcefully in favor of in his book Public Parts .        
 But here’s the problem with slips like Huhne’s: They aren’t failures of control; they are failures of technology.        
 Regardless of the content of his message, the real issue is that Twitter’s architecture makes it incredibly easy to make the same mistake. There can’t be many of us who have never sent a direct message to our public accounts by mistake. Twitter has made changes to the system over the years, but day after day, people are still making this mistake.        
 Will Twitter ever fix this? Can it?        
 I don’t know, but I fear if they don’t, the service risks losing people who worry about these kind of mistakes happening. Whatever you think about Twitter’s value to the public sphere, it’s been refreshing for many people to be able to contact their representatives directly this way. But every slip-up makes it a little harder for conservative politicians and public figures to make the decision to sign up.        
 Can you blame them? I doubt any of us would press send so hastily if there were a button labelled “IMPLODE CAREER”.        
 But it would be a shame to lose out simply because politicians and public figures get too worried about pressing the wrong button. So please, Twitter, do something. You may regret it otherwise.

Comcast is testing out a new type of pay TV bundling that gives users the ability to pick and choose which types of content they want to pay for month after month. The MyTV Choice trial, which was just introduced in Comcast’s Charleston, S.C. market, isn’t true a la carte offering, as some folks like to think of it, but it’s a step toward more personalized programming choices becoming available to customers.        
 For eligible customers, MyTV Choice works like this: You choose from one of two ‘Get Started’ packages, which include the major broadcast networks and some additional basic cable networks. The choice basically comes down to whether or not you want to pay for sports networks like ESPN, which cost an additional $20 a month.        
 Get Started. This tier features approximately 55-60 channels, including local broadcast networks and popular cable networks such as A&E, Comedy Central, E!, FX and more. Priced at $24.95. Get Started Plus. This includes all the same content as the Get Started tier, as well as an additional 12-15 entertainment and sports channels, including regional sports networks, ESPN, ESPN2, Golf Channel, Versus, BBC America and Military Channel. Priced at $44.95. 
 Users can then customize their channels, with bundles of content organized into themes. Each channel pack costs an additional $10 on top of the Get Started package. Video-on-demand options would contain content from the networks people have chosen to subscribe to. Additional channel packs are as follows:        
 Kids. Includes networks such as ABC Family, Disney, Nickelodeon, PBS Sprout and TeenNick. News & Info. Provides news channels, including Bloomberg, CNN, Fox Business, MSNBC and National Geographic. Entertainment & Lifestyle. Has entertainment networks such as Bravo, CMT, MTV, Style and VH1. Movie. Includes networks like Encore, Flix, IFC, Lifetime Movies and MoviePlex. 
 The Charleston trial isn’t the first test of the MyTV Choice offering; it’s also available to customers in Comcast’s Seattle and Western New England markets. But in those other markets, MyTV Choice is available only as part of a larger, triple-play package that includes broadband and digital voice service. Charleston’s offering starts as video-only package, but a Comcast spokesperson told us by phone that pricing for triple-play or additional services would be similar to pricing in the other trial markets, which starts at $92.95 for the Get Started package and $109.95 for Get Started Plus.        
 We’ve written about the Great Cable Unbundling before, and this is the latest evidence that operators are thinking seriously about moving away from giant, one-size-fits-all packages of programming to more flexible and more affordable packages of content. That’s becoming increasingly important, particularly as fewer and fewer Americans have the discretionary income to pay upwards of $100 a month for a TV subscription.        
 It’s too early to say if the package will catch on, or if MyTV Choice will become generally available in other markets. A Comcast spokesperson said the cable provider plans to monitor the results of the trial to determine how effective the service offering is, or if it’s worth rolling out more broadly.        
 My gut feeling, though, is that there are plenty of people who would love to save $20 a month, even if it means not having access to ESPN, or who would rather opt-in to having access to a channel for $10 a month rather than paying for a bundle of programming they never watch. That could not only save subscribers some money, but could help Comcast to fight back against the threat of users abandoning its service because it’s too expensive or doesn’t provide enough value.

Hoping to extend a social game franchise, 6waves Lolapps is launching its new Ravenskye City game today.        
 The game is an expansion of the existing Raven series of games that have been a major hit for 6waves Lolapps. If it takes off, then 6waves Lolapps will have a more predictable way of maintaining its audience via franchise sequels. That’s very similar to the way console game companies extend the audiences for their games.        
 The expansion, which will be available for users today on Facebook, shows that the social game industry is evolving and becoming more mature. Other social game companies such as Zynga have followed the same tactic . By pursuing this strategy, Lolapps has been able to raise more money, double the size of its development team, and attract some key talent from traditional video game companies.        
 6waves Lolapps has more than 17 million monthly active users, according to market analyst Appdata . Its top game, Ravenwood Fair, has more than 4.5 million monthly active users. That’s down from its all-time high of 11.9 million monthly active users, so it’s time to give the game a shot in the arm.        
 Back in April, the company launched its Ravenstone Mine expansion for the original game. But Kavin Stewart, co-founder (pictured at top on the right) said in an interview that the development team is trying to make some big improvements in the game play for the new title. With the older games, you spend a lot of time “grinding,” or doing repetitive tasks to level up, such as chopping down 300 trees.        
 “We punched up the storytelling,” said Constantine Hantzopoulos, vice president of content at Lolapps, in an interview. “That’s one of the things we learned from Ravenwood Fair.”        
 In Ravenskye City, there’s more real storytelling and quests. You happen upon a floating city that is abandoned and overgrown with weeds. You have to clear the brush and restore the city to its former glory.        
 For the past four months, the Lolapps team in San Francisco has been working on the title. It is using the Fliso flash game engine , which speeds the performance of Adobe’s Flash software dramatically and allows for prettier graphics such as floating clouds and rain. Another game, Ravenshire Castle, is also in the works.        
 “We call this the Raven world brand,” Stewart said. “It is the overarching intellectual property and we can craft different game experiences under it.”        
 At its core, the title is an exploration and building game. Users undertake quests to unlock and restore various buildings in the city. The game is targeted at older female gamers and, in general, a mass market audience on Facebook. The characters are all bird-like, and some of them even look a little like Angry Birds characters.        
 The game has a lot of humor, with a chicken-like statue dubbed Poyo Loco. There are tornado storms that spin through the city and rainclouds that drop rain. The game is fast-paced. It has plenty of decorations and room for personalization. If you run out of energy, you can pay real money to buy some more.        
 Stewart said the team plans to release new content on a regular basis for at least six months after the game launches. 6waves Lolapps will cross-promote the game in hopes of snagging a lot of users. Overall, 6waves Lolapps has more than 150 people. A team of veterans from Sega, LucasArts, Bethesda Softworks, Blue Fang Games, Pixar and elsewhere built the game. Hantzopoulos himself was previously a studio director at Sega of America and before that a senior producer at Atari.        
 The company has offices in San Francisco, Hong Kong and elsewhere. It was formed by the merger of Hong Kong’s 6waves and San Francisco’s Lolapps . The aim of the Lolapps internal development team is to make increasingly addictive titles, so that you’ll always want to play one more game session before you go back to work or to bed, Hantzopoulos said.        
 Check out the trailer for the game below.

For many people, a simple “Happy Birthday” on a friend’s Facebook wall is enough. But a startup called Giftiki is launching a new group gift-giving tool Monday to make a birthdays a bigger deal using Facebook.        
 The idea behind the company is to allow friends to chip in together to buy a friend a combined gift. Giftiki connects friends on Facebook to have them give a small monetary gift. After more and more friends leave small amounts of money, the birthday boy or girl can use it to buy the one gift they really want.        
 I should note that gift giving isn’t just for birthdays, users could also leave gifts for weddings, honeymoons, graduations and more.        
 Users can give anywhere from $1 to $10. Each gift is accompanied by a message and icon, like a birthday cake, cupcake or banana. The gift is posted to the recipient’s Facebook wall, where he or she can open it and be taken to Giftiki to sign up and redeem the gift. The company also has what it calls a Gift-O-Meter (pictured), which shows users the total amount gifted to date.        
 The service doesn’t let you redeem a gift for actual cash. You can redeem it for an American Express gift card or with online retailers like Amazon, Macy’s, Starbucks or Sports Authority. Giftiki doesn’t charge users or gift recipients but makes its money by buying the redeemable gift cards from the various online retailers at a discount. For example, a $50 gift card you redeem for Amazon only costs Giftiki $40. (This is only an example of the profit Giftiki makes, the company wouldn’t share actual percentages.)        
 Giftiki also notes that it has secured a partnership with American Express and its Serve mobile payments process (available soon). As VentureBeat writer Jolie O’Dell noted in previous coverage, Serve combines mobile, online and offline payment features and targets users who rely heavily on their mobile phones, whether they are young, tech-savvy users or users in developing areas, where people are more likely to have a phone than a computer. Serve accounts can be funded from a bank account, from a debit or credit card, or by receiving money from another Serve account.        
 “Giftiki is pioneering a new space in collaborative commerce that allows a new form of trade to occur,” said investor Tim Draper. “I expect this business to spread like the wind. My friends can expect to see a giftiki from me soon.”        
 Giftiki isn’t the only one looking to give groups a way to gift together. The space appears to be relatively crowded with sites like eDivvy.com, LetsGift.it, Wrapp and The Gifts Project, which was recently acquired by eBay.        
 The San Francisco-based company, founded in 2010, recently secured a first round of funding for $1 million led by investor Tim Draper and included GoldHill Capital, Crosslink Capital and Transmedia Capital.

NOTE: Each week, I’m writing a column on videogames called The DeanBeat that’s available to newsletter subscribers a day before it appears on the VentureBeat website. This week, my column was co-written with Matthew Lynley. 
 The fall blockbuster video game season is under way and we thought it would be useful to update readers on our opinions about the best games of the fall. We previously wrote about our favorite games from the E3 trade show back in June and our most anticipated titles , but now we’re focused only on the games that are coming out for the fall and holiday seasons. One switch from then is that Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3 is looking stronger as a title compared to Uncharted 3: Drake’s Deception. But we’ll have to watch these closely as you never can tell just how well each game is executed until you play it for real. At the end of the year, we’ll have our usual list on the best games of the year. In the meantime, we’ll be putting a lot of hours into the games below.        
 1. Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3 Developer : Infinity Ward and Sledgehammer Games Publisher : Activision Blizzard Platforms : Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, PC Release date : Nov. 8        
 Call of Duty games have become the entertainment event of the year. Each title is consistently generating more than $1 billion a year in sales, and this year should be no different. Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3 will be another intense combat game where you have to constantly shoot enemies until your hands tremble from overworking your controller (or mouse). This game always takes gamers on a trip around the globe to exotic places where you have to shoot everybody you meet. But now the war against madmen terrorists has spread to some of the world’s biggest cities: New York, London and Paris. The single-player campaign has you fighting underwater, in the middle of a Wall Street stock exchange, on speeding trains and in the air with dueling helicopter gunships. The formula for Call of Duty games is to deliver epic realism with combat scenes that are believable and intense, fast game play at 60 frames per second, over-the-top Hollywood-style action, and “easy to play, hard to master.” This year, you can control new Reaper drones, study your stats in the Call of Duty Elite social network , and fight hordes of enemies in the Spec Ops cooperative multiplayer mode.        
 The single-player stories in these games are sometimes a little weak, but the cinematic intros always do a good job of setting up combat scenes. We expect this game to become the most popular this fall not because of its single-player campaign, but the multiplayer combat that turns the game into a year-round avocation. The combination of cool weapons, fast game play, well-crafted multiplayer maps, and a reward-based leveling up system make the game more fun to play than just about any other multiplayer combat game. In the multibillion-dollar first-person shooter market, this game is the one to beat. 
 2. Uncharted 3: Drake’s Deception Developer : Naughty Dog Publisher : Sony Platform : PlayStation 3 Release date : Nov. 1        
 Uncharted 2: Among Thieves walked away with tons of awards in 2009 because of its cinematic story, outstanding graphics, and well-executed combat scenes. It is an action adventure series that has plenty of humor and action scenes that are better than an Indiana Jones movie — sometimes. With Uncharted 3, we expect more of the same. The story will likely be very film-like again, with cinematic scenes lasting for minutes. As you can see in the screenshot, the hero Nathan Drake has to maneuver through a multi-story burning building with his friend Sully. You have to fight enemies as the building comes crashing down around you. You can’t really get more cinematic or graphically intense than that.        
 The game has an interesting new female villain, Katherine Marlowe, who will likely motivate gamers to move on to the next level over and over again. In addition, Sony has shown that the multiplayer combat is great.        
 This is likely to be more like a summer blockbuster-style movie than Call of Duty. But it will be a close call as to which game beats out the other for the best game of the year. Uncharted may have an edge because of its storytelling success in the past. But Call of Duty has the combination of fun single-player campaigns and outstanding multiplayer. That’s a tough combination to beat.        
 3. Battlefield 3 Developer : EA DICE Publisher : Electronic Arts Platforms : Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, PC Release date : Oct. 25        
 The latest multiplayer beta test of Battlefield 3 on the PC shows that the graphics are outstanding and the game play is ultra-realistic. In this game, you’ll be able to play in vehicles, in the air or on foot as you take on the modern armies and terrorists. If Modern Warfare 3 is going to be over-the-top fun, Battlefield 3 is going to deliver some gritty realism. The game won’t necessarily move as fast as Modern Warfare 3, but it will have destructible environments such as walls that you can shoot through and more accurate physics.        
 We haven’t seen much of the single-player game, where the quality will really be tested. But the trailers that EA has shown so far look like the combat scenes will be intense and filled with the shock of ambushes. The question is whether the game is going to be as fun as it is realistic. We’ve got high hopes, since EA has been steadily learning how to make games as competitive as Activision Blizzard in this all-important segment. Whether this game beats Call of Duty or not, analysts are predicting that it will sell in the millions.        
 4. Gears of War 3 Developer : Epic Games Publisher : Microsoft Platform : Xbox 360 Release date : Sep. 20        
 This game wraps up a saga that first began eight years ago with the original Gears of War. Gears of War has sold more than 16 million copies as a series so far, and it has been a potent exclusive for Microsoft in the console wars.        
 In this swan song, Epic Games hits us with an emotional story about brotherhood, survival and loss. The new installment introduces the game’s first female characters and it brings to a close the story about Marcus Fenix and his lost father that began in the original. The game play is intense and familiar, but now you can play in a four-person cooperative mode. The enemies are bigger and badder, and they include not only the underground-dwelling Locust Horde but also the new and nasty Lambent enemies. The familiar chainsaw bayonet is back and so are staples such as the Hammer of God satellite guns. It’s a fitting and emotional end to the series.        
 5. Assassin’s Creed Revelations Developer : Ubisoft Publisher : Ubisoft Platforms : XBox 360, PlayStation 3, PC Release date : Nov. 30

Sprint, the third-largest cellular carrier in the US, announced its plans today for an “aggressive roll-out” of LTE 4G technology on its network, starting in the middle of 2012.        
 As part of the upgrade, Sprint will simplify its cellular site hardware, optimize its use of wireless spectrum, and kill off its iDEN network (which is used for push-to-talk features).        
 For Sprint, the announcement couldn’t come soon enough, as its WiMax 4G network is beginning to show its age, and both Verizon and AT&T have already launched their faster LTE 4G networks. Even T-Mobile, the smallest of the big four US carriers, has been more aggressive about its 4G plans with its HSPA+ network, which can achieve speeds close to LTE.        
 The carrier describes its LTE rollout as “rapid.” It will launch its first LTE markets in mid-2012 and expects to be mostly complete by the end of 2013. Verizon, in comparison, expects to achieve nationwide LTE availability by 2013 as well. Sprint says it’s still committed to WiMax for now, and it will be selling those devices until 2012. (But you can expect WiMax to be killed off within the next few years.)        
 Sprint’s new multimode hardware will allow it to combine 3G and 4G hardware, instead of running them as separate units. New integrated chipsets in mobile devices will allow them to take better advantage of multiple wireless spectrums and multimode technology. Sprint’s multimode antennas will be able to broadcast both CDMA and LTE across 800 and 1900 MHz spectrums. As previously announced, the carrier will also offer LTE wholesale to Lightsquared, which also gives Sprint access to the 1600 MHz spectrum.        
 Developing, refresh for updates.

 All indications pointed to a Samsung Nexus Prime (or Galaxy Nexus) debut Oct. 11 at CTIA Fall in San Diego , but now Google and Samsung have decided to delay its big introduction.        
 Samsung and Google curiously sent out the following statement this morning:        
 
 Samsung and Google decide to postpone the new product announcement at CTIA Fall. We agree that it is just not the right time to announce a new product. New date and venue will be shortly announced.        
 
 Not only had Samsung posted a promotional video teasing a “big” smartphone that looks like the Nexus Prime, but also Google apparently leaked when Ice Cream Sandwich would launch through a YouTube livestream placeholder. With all this pre-established hype, it’s quite strange that the two companies have decided to delay the launch.        
 Three possibilities come to mind off the top of my head for why the companies decided to postpone. First, the companies may not have attracted enough press to attend the event at CTIA in San Diego and decided to push it back to a New York launch where attendance will be higher. Second, perhaps Google needed a little extra time to polish the Ice Cream Sandwich OS. Third, the companies could have decided at the last minute to distance the launch of their flagship Android phone by more than a week from the iPhone 4S.        
 We don’t expect to wait long for another date to be set, though, because Google Chairman Eric Schmidt said Ice Cream Sandwich would launch before November . I absolutely believe that timeline because Google and Samsung will want to take advantage of increased holiday sales.        
 The Nexus Prime’s leaked specs do sound pretty impressive and could attract those that were disappointed by the iPhone 4S introduction. The smartphone will feature a massive 4.65-inch display with curved glass, a 1.2-gigahertz dual core processor and LTE 4G connectivity through Verizon.        
 Are you excited about the Nexus Prime?

American stargazers could be forgiven for shaking a fist at the heavens this weekend. The Draconids meteor shower is expected to yield intense shooting-star activity, but by the time the sun sets on the United States, the action will most likely have ended.        
 Fortunately, you can still track and watch coming meteor showers and other astronomical phenomena if you have a smartphone loaded with Meteor Shower Guide ($1 on Apple) or Meteor Shower Calendar (free on Android ), and two great star-viewing apps, StarWalk ( $3 on iPhone ; $5 on iPad ) and Google Sky Map (free on Android).        
 Now is a good time for stargazing, particularly with children. The night sky is more clearly visible in mid-evening than in the summer months, and for people in the Northern states, it’s not so cold that everyone will run inside after spotting Orion’s belt.        
 Of course, a clear sky is crucial, so a good weather app is important for planning. My favorite, MyWeather Mobile, is free on Apple and Android. It’s slower to load than my other go-to weather app, Weather+ (also free on Apple and Android), but it offers a fuller spectrum of weather information and longer forecast periods.        
 Oddly, none of the major weather apps include information on moon phases, which is an important detail for lawn-chair astronomers, since it’s hard to see celestial objects in a brightly lit sky.        
 But you can find moon phases on both of the meteor-specific apps on my list, Meteor Shower Guide and Meteor Shower Calendar. Both offer schedules of the year’s meteor showers, along with ratings and the moon’s phase on the date of the shower’s peak.        
 The extra cost of Meteor Shower Guide is justified in the additional information you’ll glean from it. The Draconids, for instance, “are very slow-moving meteors,” the app says. Hourly meteor rates are typically low, it added, “but on several occasions outbursts of 50 or more meteors per hour have been reported.”        
 For people who miss the Draconids, though, Meteor Shower Guide and Meteor Shower Calendar offer an alternative — the Northern Taurids shower, which starts on Oct. 20 and peaks on Nov. 12.        
 Ideally, the apps would account for the likelihood that you would see a shower in your particular region, and then identify the least moonlit nights for stargazing. But they leave that sort of legwork to you.        
 Likewise, you must go online if you want to identify the best available spots for stargazing in your area. ClearDarkSky.com , a Web site for astronomers, publishes state-by-state lists of public and private observation spots and an astronomer’s forecast.        
 To my knowledge, no app yet exists with such information. I’d give it a week.        
 It’s surprising that neither Google Sky Map nor StarWalk include this information in their own apps, since they feature so much else. Both have long been the standard for the general astronomy category, and for good reason. If you hold a device toward the sky and look through the viewfinder, it labels the celestial objects beyond. No more guessing about whether that dot is a planet or a star; no more mistaking the Big Dipper for the Little Dipper.        
 Of the many features on Sky Map, the one for meteor showers is the newest. In the “settings” section of the app, there are several so-called layers, for viewing different objects. If you want to just see planets, for instance, you can uncheck stars, constellations and other elements on the list. If you want to put yourself in the best position to view a meteor shower, though, uncheck all else and point the device skyward. When there is a shower predicted, graphics will point to the area where meteors will most likely appear. If you know the name of the meteor shower, you can also type it into the search box and the screen will show the general location.        
 Star Walk uses a different approach. In the Calendar section, the app lists important astrological events like solstices and meteor showers, along with more information on each item. If you tap an event in the calendar, the screen goes into a time-travel mode, in which the sky appears as it would on the date of the event, with an arrow pointing to the part of the sky where you’ll see a simulation of the event.        
 One of the nice aspects of this feature is that you can point the device in the direction of the event and see if it would be visible from your yard. It feels almost like cheating.        
 But the app would have come in handy for me this summer, when trying to help my younger children cross a big item — “see a shooting star” — from their bucket list. On the first night we tried, only one of them saw a meteor, with expected emotional results. The next night we tried again, and — miracle of miracles — we all saw a few just before the clouds rolled in.        
 Serendipity has its place, no doubt. But a little smartphone-aided serendipity never hurts.        
 QUICK CALLS Back in Time ($8 on iPad) is a beautifully executed lesson on the history of the universe and the evolution of life on earth. Great for high school students or parents who’d like to tutor younger children and enjoy a first-rate experience of their own.... Zappos fans should check out the company’s mobile app (free on Apple and Android), which makes browsing and buying from the company easier and faster. ... Hanging with Friends , a word game from the makers of Words with Friends, may be equally addictive.

The economics of an all-you-can-eat buffet are pretty easy to figure out. The restaurant makes money as long as most of the diners don’t have big appetites and enormous capacity for engorgement.        
 It hasn’t taken Internet service providers very long to conclude that their all-you-can-eat pricing isn’t as profitable as charging those who use more bandwidth streaming videos and music more money than those who pop on for a quick Facebook chat. Many are adopting flat-rate pricing or pricing tiers. The more you use, the more you pay. Many are even imposing limits on their customers.        
 Comcast, for instance, limits its customers to 250 gigabytes a month, a threshold that it estimates affects no more than a few percent of its customers. The limits are much lower for wireless data providers like the cellphone companies. Verizon, for instance, offers plans with limits of 2, 5 or 10 gigabytes a month.        
 Complain all you want about the new plans, but there are only two ways around the problem: Use less or pay more.        
 Much of the advice on how to use less bandwidth will sound a lot like what you’d hear from any dietician who catches you at the smorgasbord: eat less or at least eat the healthy foods. It’s not an emotionally satisfying answer, but when it comes to broadband, it is either that or pay more.        
 Like any diet plan, there are a few tips for making that easier.        
 ¶ Watch the meter. All of the I.S.P.’s with the new limits provide mechanisms for tracking your consumption on their Web site. Comcast, for instance, has a data usage meter in the customer service section of its Web site. If you end up near the limit, you can throttle back a little more — or get a second job.        
 ¶ Install bandwidth meter software on your computer. This will only measure how much you consume from that computer, not every computer sharing your connection, but that can still be useful. The new caps are inspiring a wide range of new packages that count how much information goes in and out of your machine and there are a number of excellent programs. Two that are well-regarded are DU Meter for the PC and iStat Menus for the Mac.        
 ¶ Cut back on video. Video files are by far the largest blocks of data delivered to the average person. One hour of a high-definition movie might be as much as 2.3 gigabytes. The text for this article is probably about 7,200 bytes plus some overhead for advertisements. That’s about one-300,000th of the movie’s size.        
 ¶ Decrease the resolution. Netflix lets users choose among “good,” “better” and “best” quality; the merely "good” quality may be one-seventh the size of the best quality. Smart algorithms reduce detail by replacing complicated patches with one average color. YouTube and Hulu also let users choose the resolution for some videos.        
 ¶ Take control of ambush video. Some Web sites include video ads that start playing immediately. A number of extensions for Web browsers can temporarily block Flash content, a common form used to embed videos in Web pages. ClickToFlash for Safari, for instance, replaces the content with a button that you can push if you want to watch it. Firefox users can get Flashblock , which does the same thing.        
 ¶ Avoid constant home surveillance. Some home video security systems stream a constant image of your house in case you want to check for damage. Others upload new images only when something moves. Being careful with the amount of surveillance can save a large amount of data.        
 ¶ Restrict your online backups. If you use an automatic backup service that uploads your data to a remote server, think twice about which files and folders you back up. Text documents for work will generally be small and put little load on the system, but if you’re filming every moment of a new baby’s life and saving it to disk, the backups will be large. Saving multiple versions of a PowerPoint presentation filled with video can also raise consumption because the backup program will dutifully ship copies of all of them across the Internet.        
 ¶ Think twice about cloud music services. If you listen frequently to streaming music services, consider buying the music you listen to frequently and storing it locally.        
 ¶ Share photos in moderation. Your friends may like seeing as many megapixels of your children as possible but full-size images from digital cameras can be quite large. Many image-sorting tools like iPhoto can produce lower-resolution images perfect for e-mailing. This compression helps both you and the recipient stay under your limit.        
 ¶ Update your operating system with care. Many operating systems offer automated updates, a nice feature that mixes essential security fixes with less important bug fixes and cosmetic changes. If you turn off the automation, you can decide to download only the updates that are important. Most software companies include a short description of the changes and the size. Often the title of important fixes will begin with words like “Security Update.”        
 ¶ Avoid e-mail attachments. Some people think nothing of sending their friends a large video file showing a cat doing something endearing. Others send big work files to large mailing lists even if only a few need the documents. Some of this can be avoided by not downloading attachments. Web-based e-mail services usually won’t deliver the attachments unless you request them. Good e-mail readers like Outlook can be configured to download only e-mail attachments smaller than a certain size.        
 ¶ Turn off e-mail images. Most image files are too small to make a difference unless the bandwidth cap is very low, but if you get many marketing messages, the image files can add up. Many Web-based e-mail packages allow you to control image loading.        
 ¶ Browse e-mail subject lines. Many smartphone e-mail clients download only the subjects and senders’ names, not the actual content. Many Web-based services, like Gmail, download the content only when you open the message.        
 ¶ Run antivirus software. Malware can take over your computer and use your bandwidth. Keep your computer clean.        
 ¶ Explore nondigital activities. There are many old-fashioned ways to spend an evening without consuming bandwidth. Consider board games, reading things printed on paper, walks in the park or quiet dinners without settling arguments by checking Wikipedia.        
The economics of an all-you-can-eat buffet are pretty easy to figure out. The restaurant makes money as long as most of the diners don’t have big appetites and enormous capacity for engorgement.

 ¶ Avoid constant home surveillance. Some home video security systems stream a constant image of your house in case you want to check for damage. Others upload new images only when something moves. Being careful with the amount of surveillance can save a large amount of data.        
 ¶ Restrict your online backups. If you use an automatic backup service that uploads your data to a remote server, think twice about which files and folders you back up. Text documents for work will generally be small and put little load on the system, but if you’re filming every moment of a new baby’s life and saving it to disk, the backups will be large. Saving multiple versions of a PowerPoint presentation filled with video can also raise consumption because the backup program will dutifully ship copies of all of them across the Internet.        
 ¶ Think twice about cloud music services. If you listen frequently to streaming music services, consider buying the music you listen to frequently and storing it locally.        
 ¶ Share photos in moderation. Your friends may like seeing as many megapixels of your children as possible but full-size images from digital cameras can be quite large. Many image-sorting tools like iPhoto can produce lower-resolution images perfect for e-mailing. This compression helps both you and the recipient stay under your limit.        
 ¶ Update your operating system with care. Many operating systems offer automated updates, a nice feature that mixes essential security fixes with less important bug fixes and cosmetic changes. If you turn off the automation, you can decide to download only the updates that are important. Most software companies include a short description of the changes and the size. Often the title of important fixes will begin with words like “Security Update.”        
 ¶ Avoid e-mail attachments. Some people think nothing of sending their friends a large video file showing a cat doing something endearing. Others send big work files to large mailing lists even if only a few need the documents. Some of this can be avoided by not downloading attachments. Web-based e-mail services usually won’t deliver the attachments unless you request them. Good e-mail readers like Outlook can be configured to download only e-mail attachments smaller than a certain size.        
 ¶ Turn off e-mail images. Most image files are too small to make a difference unless the bandwidth cap is very low, but if you get many marketing messages, the image files can add up. Many Web-based e-mail packages allow you to control image loading.        
 ¶ Browse e-mail subject lines. Many smartphone e-mail clients download only the subjects and senders’ names, not the actual content. Many Web-based services, like Gmail, download the content only when you open the message.        
 ¶ Run antivirus software. Malware can take over your computer and use your bandwidth. Keep your computer clean.        
 ¶ Explore nondigital activities. There are many old-fashioned ways to spend an evening without consuming bandwidth. Consider board games, reading things printed on paper, walks in the park or quiet dinners without settling arguments by checking Wikipedia.
