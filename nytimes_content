MESA, Ariz. — At first glance, it had the makings of a spirited election: the leader of Arizona’s crackdown on illegal immigration facing off at the polls with an immigrant from Mexico who believed that the state had gone too far.        
 But the immigrant, Olivia Cortes, a retiree who filed papers in July to challenge the State Senate president, Russell Pearce , disappeared from the political scene last week just as quickly as she had appeared. Ms. Cortes’s candidacy for a legislative district in this working-class community east of Phoenix, it now appears, had been a dirty trick.        
 Critics of Mr. Pearce’s hard-line approach to illegal immigration collected enough signatures to force him into a recall election in November. But allies of Mr. Pearce , who is one of the state’s most powerful politicians, did not take that humiliation lightly. They recruited Ms. Cortes in what was an effort to split the anti-Pearce vote, particularly among Latinos, a judge later found.        
 Greg Western, a Pearce ally who is the chairman of the East Valley Tea Party , was a central figure in the scheme and became Ms. Cortes’s campaign adviser. Soon, signs promoting Ms. Cortes’s candidacy appeared on street corners, bearing the motto made famous by Cesar Chavez of the United Farm Workers: “Sí, Se Puede!”        
 Ms. Cortes avoided the news media for weeks, and the few interviews she did give showed her to be shaky on the issues. Her candidacy began falling apart after another candidate, Jerry Lewis, who like Mr. Pearce is a Republican, began his own campaign. Allies of Mr. Lewis’s went to court to challenge Ms. Cortes’s election bid as a sham.        
 The judge, Edward O. Burke of Superior Court of Maricopa County, declined to remove her from the ballot but did say that the evidence suggested that some of her so-called supporters really supported Mr. Pearce. “The court finds that Pearce supporters recruited Cortes, a political neophyte, to run in the recall election to siphon Hispanic votes from Lewis to advance Pearce’s recall election bid,” the judge said in his ruling.        
 Still, Judge Burke said he found no wrongdoing by Ms. Cortes herself and believed her testimony that she, a naturalized American citizen from Veracruz, Mexico, opposes “what she believes is Pearce’s harsh legislative treatment and comments about illegal Hispanic immigrants.”        
 The judge said the Cortes case was distinct from others in which sham candidates were put forward, including a dispute from upstate New York in which opponents of Linda H. Overbaugh, a candidate for the Greene County Legislature, circulated petitions in 2009 on behalf of a Linda L. Overbaugh, who had not given her consent to run.        
 The judge also said Ms. Cortes’s case did not resemble the subterfuge displayed in “The Distinguished Gentleman,” a movie in which the actor Eddie Murphy, playing a character named Jeff Johnson, runs for Congress after an incumbent with the same name dies.        
 “The court assumes that candidates have run for office for less than the noble motive of serving the public, which could include getting a better-paying job, pension benefits, achieving a position of perceived importance, boredom, or no reason at all,” Judge Burke said. “Divining candidates’ motives and acting on them is more properly the role of voters.”        
 But Ms. Cortes’s candidacy fell apart after Mr. Lewis’s allies said they had uncovered evidence of even more links between Ms. Cortes and Mr. Pearce, noting for instance that Mr. Pearce’s nieces had helped collect signatures to get Ms. Cortes on the ballot and that one of Mr. Pearce’s brothers, Lester, who is a justice of the peace and is prohibited from campaigning, accompanied them.        
 Instead of facing another court hearing on Friday, in which Mr. Pearce’s relatives were subpoenaed, Ms. Cortes agreed through her lawyer to pull out of the race.        
 But ballots listing the names of Mr. Pearce, Mr. Lewis and Ms. Cortes have already been prepared. Election officials said they would post notices at polling places for Election Day on Nov. 8, informing voters that Ms. Cortes was no longer running.        
 Mr. Pearce’s detractors insisted on Friday that new ballots that do not mention Ms. Cortes should be printed so that no voter would be confused.        
 It remained unclear who exactly financed Ms. Cortes’s short-lived campaign, which employed a professional signature gatherer, produced untold lawn signs, created a Web site and issued occasional news releases that borrow Superman’s theme, “Truth, Justice and the American Way.”        
 At a debate on Thursday that was supposed to be Ms. Cortes’s first public appearance in the race, there were only two candidates, Mr. Pearce and Mr. Lewis. They clashed on immigration, with Mr. Pearce arguing that illegal immigrants are a burden on the state and Mr. Lewis pushing for what he called a more humane approach on the issue.        
 At one point, Mr. Lewis lamented Arizona’s poor image, which he said is “something akin to 1964 Alabama.”        
 Pearce allies in the crowd groaned heartily.        
 Mr. Pearce said he liked the state’s image just as it is. “We are in the front of the parade,” he said, noting that other states, among them 2011 Alabama, had followed Arizona’s attempt to drive illegal immigrants away.        
 Ms. Cortes’s candidacy was not debated, but afterward Mr. Pearce was called by reporters, who grilled him on the issue. He denied being behind Ms. Cortes’s candidacy and said he had spoken to his nieces about their involvement. “I wouldn’t have done it,” he said. “I wish they hadn’t done it.”        
 Outside the debate, partisans for each candidate waved signs at the other side.        
 “Russell Pearce mentioned the Constitution six times tonight, and Jerry Lewis mentioned it zero,” said Craig Ray, a Pearce ally who was convinced that his candidate would stave off the challenge.        
 “He’s a one-issue senator,” Al Moncayo, a retired building inspector of Mexican descent, said of Mr. Pearce, whom he wants ousted. “It’s all about immigration to him. As for Olivia Cortes, she’s probably a nice lady. I don’t know her personally. But, come on.”        
 Ms. Cortes did not respond to a telephone call, an e-mail or a knock at her door.

Representative Michele Bachmann promises to “turn out the lights” at the federal Education Department . Gov. Rick Perry calls it unconstitutional. Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker, would allow it to live but only as a drastically shrunken agency that mainly gathers statistics.        
 Even Mitt Romney , who in 2008 ran for president defending No Child Left Behind , the federal law that vastly expanded Washington’s role in public schools, now says, “We need to get the federal government out of education.”        
 For a generation, there has been loose bipartisan agreement in Washington that the federal government has a necessary role to play in the nation’s 13,600 school districts, primarily by using money to compel states to raise standards.        
 But the field of Republican presidential candidates has promised to unwind this legacy, arguing that education responsibilities should devolve to states and local districts, which will do a better job than Washington.        
 It can seem like an eon has passed since George W. Bush aspired to be the “education president.” Mr. Bush’s prized No Child Left Behind law used billions of dollars of federal aid to compel schools to raise student achievement on standardized tests.        
 President Obama’s own signature education initiative, Race to the Top, similarly used federal money to leverage change that many Republicans had long endorsed — charter schools and teacher evaluations that tied effectiveness in the classroom to tenure.        
 But now, the quest to sharply shrink government that all the Republican candidates embrace, driven by the fervor of the Tea Party , has brought a sweeping anti-federalism to the fore on education, as in many other areas.        
 The question is whether states and local districts, without Washington’s various carrots and sticks, will continue to raise academic standards and give equal opportunity to traditionally ignored student populations.        
 “People want government money, they want higher standards, they want greater accountability,” said Chester E. Finn Jr., president of the Thomas B. Fordham Institute, a conservative-leaning education policy group, who was an education official in the Reagan administration. “None of those things in most places comes from local control.”        
 So far, the candidates have not been specific about what a drastically reduced federal role would look like. Education has not become a major issue, and when candidates do address it, they tend to paint the Education Department with the same broad brush used to criticize Mr. Obama for what they see as government overreach on health care, Wall Street reform and the environment.        
 Tom Luna, the elected superintendent of schools in Idaho, said Washington’s oversight of education is different from health care or environmental regulations. The Education Department dispenses a large share of its billions of dollars to states and local districts on the condition that they uphold two pillars of national law — that students who are economically disadvantaged and students who are disabled get extra classroom enrichment.        
 “If you’re a conservative Republican like I consider myself,” said Mr. Luna, who is also president-elect of the Council of Chief State School Officers, “there has to be accountability for how those dollars are spent. We can’t send them to schools or states with no accountability.”        
 The change in Republican perspective is most noticeable with Mr. Romney and Mr. Perry, who earlier in their political careers supported No Child Left Behind. That 2002 law required states to show yearly progress in the number of students who were proficient in English and math, although it allowed states to measure proficiency in their own ways. Mr. Perry participated in a news conference heralding federal officials’ approval of the Texas plan for putting the law in place, providing $400 million for the state.        
 But today he complains of “unfunded mandates” in federal education laws that require Texas, he says, to spend more to meet the rules than it receives in federal dollars. He was one of four governors who refused to compete in Race to the Top, a grant contest that he called “a federal takeover of public schools.”        
 Margaret Spellings, the education secretary in the latter years of the Bush administration, said that before No Child Left Behind, when federal laws had few strings attached, many states showed little progress raising student achievement, especially for poor and minority students. “We tried that for 40 years,” she said. “The results were far from stellar.”

 1 2 Next Page »SACRAMENTO (Reuters) - California Governor Jerry Brown on Saturday signed a bill giving illegal immigrant college students access to state-funded financial aid, the second half of two-part legislation known as the "Dream Act."        
 The controversial measure, which passed the Democrat-controlled legislature on a party-line vote in September, represents a victory for immigrant-rights activists ahead of the 2012 presidential election. California is the nation's most populous state.        
 Only two other states, Texas and New Mexico, allow illegal immigrants to qualify for state financial aid for college, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.        
 "Going to college is a dream that promises intellectual excitement and creative thinking," Brown said in a written statement issued by his office.        
 "The Dream Act benefits us all by giving top students a chance to improve their lives and the lives of all of us," he said.        
 Brown in July fulfilled a campaign promise by signing into law a companion bill to allow illegal immigrants to receive privately-funded college scholarships. Together the two bills have been dubbed the "California Dream Act."        
 A federal Dream Act that would have created a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants who attend college or serve in the military failed in Senate last year.        
 Opponents of the California Dream Act have argued that public funds should not be used to help illegal immigrants, especially as California faces deep budget woes that have prompted cuts in education and higher tuitions at the state's public colleges and universities.        
 "Citizens are having a hard enough time getting the classes they need now," Assemblyman Tim Donnelly, a Hesperia Republican, wrote in a September 9 letter to Brown urging him to veto the legislation.        
 "(California already offers) students in the country illegally in-state tuition; legally documented students from the next state over can only dream of such a benefit," Donnelly said.        
 California is one of about a dozen states that allows illegal immigrants to pay in-state tuition, based on attendance and graduation from a state high school.        
 Under the new law, written by Senator Gil Cedillo, a Los Angeles Democrat, those same illegal immigrants would be eligible for aid from the University of California, California State university system and the state's 112 community colleges .        
 They could also apply for Cal Grants, which are cash awards based on academic performance.        
 For the 2007-2008 academic year, the University of California reports that less than three-tenths of one percent of the system's 220,000 students were immigrants who qualified for in-state tuition.        
 More than 68 percent of those 1,941 students were U.S. citizens or "documented" immigrants, according to the University of California.        
 At the state universities, the new law would affect 3,633 students, or less than one percent of the 440,000 students enrolled in the current school year.        
 Of the nearly 2.9 million community college enrollees, 34,057 would be affected

LOS ANGELES — Facing an unprecedented order from the Supreme Court to decrease its inmate population by 11,000 over the next three months and by 34,000 over the next two years, California prisons last week began to shift inmates to county jails and probation officers, starting what many believe will be a fundamental and far-reaching change in the nation’s largest corrections system.        
 Last spring, the Supreme Court ruled that overcrowding and poor conditions in state prisons violated inmates’ constitutional rights and, in a first, ordered a state to rapidly decrease its inmate population. Gov. Jerry Brown and the Legislature approved a plan that would place many more offenders in the custody of individual counties.        
 Under the plan, inmates who have committed nonviolent, nonserious and nonsexual offenses will be released back to the county probation system rather than to state parole officers. Those newly convicted of such crimes will be sent directly to the counties, which will decide if they should go to a local jail or to an alternative community program. And newly accused defendants may wear electronic monitoring bracelets while they await trial.        
 “This is the largest change in the California state system in my lifetime,” said Barry Krisberg , a law professor at the University of California, Berkeley, who has watched the state prisons for decades and testified in the Supreme Court case last year. “Given that what we had was completely broken and was the most expensive, overcrowded and least effective in America, there’s some hope that this will change it.”        
 The shift of prisoners to county facilities began Monday, and state officials expect to satisfy the Supreme Court’s mandate by June 2013 — at which time they must have reduced the state inmate population of 144,000, which put the prisons at 180 percent capacity, to 110,000, or 135 percent of capacity. First, though, they must reach the initial court-ordered benchmark by reducing the prison population to 133,000 by December.        
 In what the state calls a realignment of the criminal justice system, the plan places more responsibilities on the counties, and some local officials say they are unprepared and underfinanced to get the job done. But state officials say that keeping inmates closer to their communities will increase the chances that they can be rehabilitated, rather than in and out of state prison.        
 For the last several years, state parole officers would often catch criminals on technical parole violations, sending them back to prison for several weeks at a time — a practice many derided as a revolving door.        
 The constant influx of new and former inmates also sharply increased the cost for the state, because it must pay for a medical evaluation and several other assessments every time an inmate enters the system.        
 Matthew Cate , the secretary of the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation , said the state hoped that the counties would concentrate on rehabilitating prisoners and helping them reintegrate into the community, something the state system was never able to do. Figures show that nearly 70 percent of inmates in California prisons end up there again.        
 “The catch-and-release way we had before was not working — I don’t know how anyone could disagree with that,” Mr. Cate said. “The only alternative we had was just a massive release of people from prison. Nobody seemed to want to talk about that.”        
 But some city and county officials say that the changes are likely to overwhelm local law enforcement agencies and that the state has not given them enough time or money to prepare. Last week, Mayor Antonio R. Villaraigosa of Los Angeles and the city’s police chief, Charlie Beck , said they would have to reassign 150 police officers to help monitor the former inmates.        
 Sheriff Scott R. Jones of Sacramento County has been one of the most outspoken critics of the plan, saying it is likely to drive up crime. He called it a “collision course with disaster,” because there is not enough money for the counties.        
 “To do all the things that they are asking everyone to do will cost an enormous amount of money, and we don’t have it,” Sheriff Jones said. “If this doesn’t work, it’s not like we get to go back and try again — we’re going to be stuck with the consequences.”        
 Sheriff Jones said the state might have been better off simply releasing 10,000 inmates, so it could use the extra time to figure out how to get more money or create a more comprehensive system for counties. “It’s not like we’re ready, because we’re not, and it’s not like we know what is best, because we don’t,” he added. “The only thing that is driving this is a court demand.”        
 But Mr. Cate dismissed the criticisms, saying the state had no other choice and had been coordinating plans for months.        
 “Everyone just wants to inoculate themselves from any kind of crime increase and blame it on realignment,” Mr. Cate said. “This is some massive change. It’s going to be subtle and happen over time.”        
 Counties across the state have been working “feverishly” to figure out their plans to handle the new responsibilities, said Sheriff Mark Pazin of Merced County, president of the California State Sheriffs’ Association .        
 “It’s a little tiring that we’re finally at the point where we have to do something and people start to react by just hitting the panic button,” Sheriff Pazin said.        
 Studies show that reduced sentences do not cause drastic increases in crime, he said, and many counties are working on alternative programs. “We need to be concentrating on what works best and how we can actually turn things around,” he said.        
 Sheriff Pazin said Mr. Brown had reassured him that the state would consider changing the way money is allocated to individual counties. Officials hope that five years from now, they will be able to determine which counties have been most effective at reducing the recidivism rate.        
 But several advocates for prisoners say they worry that the state is not doing enough to ensure that the counties will consider alternatives to jail, and several counties have said they will deal with the influx simply by adding more beds to their jails. Many of the county jails across the state are already overcrowded, and the Los Angeles County jails are being investigated by the F.B.I. over accusations of inmate abuse by deputies .        
 “There are no kind of guiding principles or oversight or monitoring,” said Donald Specter, the director of the Prison Law Office , which argued for the prisoners in the Supreme Court case. “I think there will be extreme variations, where some counties just will use the money to lock them up with no support and others who really try to figure out real solutions.”        
 Any violent crime committed by one of the former inmates is likely to grab headlines, but it will be years before the state can measure the impact of the change.        
 “We don’t have a lot of options,” Mr. Cate said. “The question years from now will really be: Did we avoid a disaster?”

 In what the state calls a realignment of the criminal justice system, the plan places more responsibilities on the counties, and some local officials say they are unprepared and underfinanced to get the job done. But state officials say that keeping inmates closer to their communities will increase the chances that they can be rehabilitated, rather than in and out of state prison.        
 For the last several years, state parole officers would often catch criminals on technical parole violations, sending them back to prison for several weeks at a time — a practice many derided as a revolving door.        
 The constant influx of new and former inmates also sharply increased the cost for the state, because it must pay for a medical evaluation and several other assessments every time an inmate enters the system.        
 Matthew Cate , the secretary of the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation , said the state hoped that the counties would concentrate on rehabilitating prisoners and helping them reintegrate into the community, something the state system was never able to do. Figures show that nearly 70 percent of inmates in California prisons end up there again.        
 “The catch-and-release way we had before was not working — I don’t know how anyone could disagree with that,” Mr. Cate said. “The only alternative we had was just a massive release of people from prison. Nobody seemed to want to talk about that.”        
 But some city and county officials say that the changes are likely to overwhelm local law enforcement agencies and that the state has not given them enough time or money to prepare. Last week, Mayor Antonio R. Villaraigosa of Los Angeles and the city’s police chief, Charlie Beck , said they would have to reassign 150 police officers to help monitor the former inmates.        
 Sheriff Scott R. Jones of Sacramento County has been one of the most outspoken critics of the plan, saying it is likely to drive up crime. He called it a “collision course with disaster,” because there is not enough money for the counties.        
 “To do all the things that they are asking everyone to do will cost an enormous amount of money, and we don’t have it,” Sheriff Jones said. “If this doesn’t work, it’s not like we get to go back and try again — we’re going to be stuck with the consequences.”        
 Sheriff Jones said the state might have been better off simply releasing 10,000 inmates, so it could use the extra time to figure out how to get more money or create a more comprehensive system for counties. “It’s not like we’re ready, because we’re not, and it’s not like we know what is best, because we don’t,” he added. “The only thing that is driving this is a court demand.”        
 But Mr. Cate dismissed the criticisms, saying the state had no other choice and had been coordinating plans for months.        
 “Everyone just wants to inoculate themselves from any kind of crime increase and blame it on realignment,” Mr. Cate said. “This is some massive change. It’s going to be subtle and happen over time.”        
 Counties across the state have been working “feverishly” to figure out their plans to handle the new responsibilities, said Sheriff Mark Pazin of Merced County, president of the California State Sheriffs’ Association .        
 “It’s a little tiring that we’re finally at the point where we have to do something and people start to react by just hitting the panic button,” Sheriff Pazin said.        
 Studies show that reduced sentences do not cause drastic increases in crime, he said, and many counties are working on alternative programs. “We need to be concentrating on what works best and how we can actually turn things around,” he said.        
 Sheriff Pazin said Mr. Brown had reassured him that the state would consider changing the way money is allocated to individual counties. Officials hope that five years from now, they will be able to determine which counties have been most effective at reducing the recidivism rate.        
 But several advocates for prisoners say they worry that the state is not doing enough to ensure that the counties will consider alternatives to jail, and several counties have said they will deal with the influx simply by adding more beds to their jails. Many of the county jails across the state are already overcrowded, and the Los Angeles County jails are being investigated by the F.B.I. over accusations of inmate abuse by deputies .        
 “There are no kind of guiding principles or oversight or monitoring,” said Donald Specter, the director of the Prison Law Office , which argued for the prisoners in the Supreme Court case. “I think there will be extreme variations, where some counties just will use the money to lock them up with no support and others who really try to figure out real solutions.”        
 Any violent crime committed by one of the former inmates is likely to grab headlines, but it will be years before the state can measure the impact of the change.        
 “We don’t have a lot of options,” Mr. Cate said. “The question years from now will really be: Did we avoid a disaster?”        
“Who the hell is Ken Dahlberg?” President Richard M. Nixon asked on June 23, 1972, his voice captured on tape in the Oval Office. He would find out soon enough. Without Kenneth H. Dahlberg, Nixon might not have become ensnared in the Watergate scandal and been forced to resign.        
 Mr. Dahlberg, who died on Tuesday at 94, became the unwitting link between the Nixon re-election campaign and the five men who, only days before Nixon’s remark, were charged with breaking into the Democratic National Committee headquarters at the Watergate complex in Washington.        
 He had been a fund-raiser for Nixon’s re-election campaign, and his name was on a $25,000 cashier’s check that had been deposited in the bank account of one of the burglars, Bernard L. Barker. The money was to help cover the burglars’ expenses, and Mr. Barker had withdrawn that amount in $100 bills. He was carrying more than $5,000 when he was arrested on June 17.        
 Bob Woodward , a young reporter for The Washington Post who with Carl Bernstein unraveled the Watergate affair, has called the Dahlberg check the “connective tissue” that turned what they thought was a story about a common crime into one of historic dimensions.        
 Nixon professed not to know who Mr. Dahlberg was, but he was in fact a prominent Minnesota businessman, Republican fund-raiser and former war hero. He sided with Republicans because he thought they, more than Democrats, understood the problems of business. He had raised money for Senator Barry M. Goldwater’s presidential campaign in 1964 and Nixon’s in 1968.        
 In 1972, Mr. Dahlberg was head of Midwestern fund-raising for the Nixon re-election campaign when he was approached by his friend Dwayne Andreas, who had turned the Archer Daniels Midland Company into a farm-products giant. Mr. Andreas wanted to contribute to the Republicans, but he also wanted to conceal it from his friend Hubert H. Humphrey, the Democratic senator and former vice president.        
 Hoping to avoid disclosing the contributions under new campaign finance laws, Mr. Andreas gave $25,000 to Mr. Dahlberg. Mr. Dahlberg converted the money into a cashier’s check written to himself and gave the check to Maurice Stans, finance chairman for the Nixon campaign.        
 The check ended up in the account of Mr. Barker, a Cuban-American former C.I.A. agent, in a bank in Boca Raton, Fla. Mr. Dahlberg later said that he had no idea how the money got there. He was never charged.        
 The Barker account, and the Dahlberg check, came to light after a Miami prosecutor, Martin F. Dardis, received a tip from a police friend in Washington that the bills Mr. Barker had carried were brand new and numbered consecutively, suggesting that they had come from a bank. Mr. Dardis traced the bills to the Boca Raton bank and subpoenaed its records to learn the identities of Mr. Barker and Mr. Dahlberg.        
 By then, Mr. Woodward and Mr. Bernstein were pursuing the story. Meeting with Mr. Bernstein in Miami, Mr. Dardis told him of the Dahlberg connection. “We’re still trying to find out who this Dahlberg guy is,” the reporters quoted Mr. Dardis as saying in their 1974 book, “All the President’s Men.” “You ever hear of him?”        
 Unable to reach Mr. Dahlberg at his home in Boca Raton and having no other number, Mr. Woodward, in Washington, asked a Post librarian to see if there was anything on Mr. Dahlberg in the paper’s files. The librarian found a picture of Mr. Dahlberg with Mr. Humphrey. Mr. Humphrey was from Minnesota. On a hunch, Mr. Woodward called information in Minneapolis and got a number for a Kenneth H. Dahlberg. Mr. Dahlberg answered the phone, acknowledged the $25,000 check and, saying, “I know I shouldn’t tell you this,” according to the Woodward-Bernstein book, proceeded to reveal that he had given the check to Mr. Stans.        
 On Aug. 1, The Post was able to report the connection between a Nixon fund-raiser and a Watergate burglar. In the book, Mr. Woodward and Mr. Bernstein recounted what Barry Sussman, the city editor, said as he edited the article: “We’ve never had a story like this. Just never.”        
 Kenneth Harry Dahlberg, whose family said he died at his home in Deephaven, Minn., was born in nearby St. Paul on June 30, 1917. He grew up in rural poverty in Wisconsin. In World War II, serving in the Army Air Forces, he was a flight instructor with Mr. Goldwater, sharing a tent with him in Yuma, Ariz.        
 Mr. Dahlberg was a triple ace in the European theater, shooting down 15 German planes. He himself was shot down and captured three times, escaping P.O.W. camps twice. His many decorations included the Distinguished Service Cross, the Army’s second-highest award for bravery.        
 His wife of 64 years, the former Betty Jayne Segerstrom, survives him, as do two daughters, Nancy Dahlberg and Dede Disbrow; a son, K. Jeffrey; a brother, Arnold; two sisters, Marcella Savage and Harriet Dolny; seven grandchildren; and five great-grandchildren.        
 In business, Mr. Dahlberg started the Miracle-Ear Hearing Aid Company, which developed one of the first hearing aids to fit inside the ear; it was also one of the first consumer products to use transistors. He sold the company in 1994 for $139 million.        
 Mr. Dahlberg attended Nixon’s funeral in 1994, though he disapproved of some of the president’s behavior. He wrote in The New York Times in 1976: “The revelations of Watergate were so repulsive that I am grateful for their exposure.”

WASHINGTON — Herman Cain suggested that Israel’s conservative prime minister would be open to allowing Palestinians right of return to the lands they fled in what is now Israel. Gov. Rick Perry suggested it was possible that American troops could be sent to Mexico if drug violence there got worse. And former Senator Rick Santorum offered that the United States should engage with the ousted Pakistani dictator Pervez Musharraf — now living in self-exile in London — to respond to the threat of Pakistan’s nuclear weapons falling into the wrong hands.        
 Many foreign policy experts regard such proposals as head-scratchers, at best, and the Republican presidential candidates have been prone to occasional blunders and posturing, as well, when delving into international affairs — that is, when they have had anything to say about the topic at all. It has often been an afterthought in the campaign — in the CNN/Tea Party debate last month, it was the second-to-last question, before the one about whether the candidates would plant vegetable gardens or put in horseshoe pits at the White House. In an election in which the economy is the overriding focus, neither candidates nor voters bring it up much on the stump.        
 Mitt Romney sought to change that on Friday when, during his first major foreign policy address before an audience of crisply clad, closely shorn cadets at The Citadel in Charleston, S.C., he called for restoring cuts to the military budget, spending more on missile defense and being tougher with Iran.        
 But he did not offer any specifics about troop levels in Afghanistan, saying he would conduct a review. And as much as anything, he used the opportunity to make a case that President Obama had surrendered American leadership around the world.        
 “If you do not want America to be the strongest nation on earth, I am not your president,” Mr. Romney said. “You have that president today.”        
 If they are united in their criticism of Mr. Obama, though, the Republican candidates differ on other issues, including the war in Afghanistan, and the primary campaign is to some degree a battle for control over the direction of foreign policy after a decade in which the party was defined by the hawkish stances of President George W. Bush and Senator John McCain, the 2008 Republican presidential nominee.        
 They have sought to capture the populist sentiment coursing through their party, as with Mr. Romney’s call for a tough trade stance toward China. But they have hardly discussed how budget constraints at home might limit their ability to project American power or what specifically they would do to break the logjam on Middle East peace talks.        
 At a time when Mr. Obama can point to the killing of Osama bin Laden and other members of Al Qaeda’s senior leadership, the Republican field is constrained in suggesting that Mr. Obama does not have the experience or fortitude to keep the nation safe. So the candidates are shifting to an argument that Mr. Obama has been too quick to apologize for the United States and unwilling to promote American exceptionalism.        
 “The message is that we unapologetically defend and promote America,” said Richard Grenell, who was the spokesman for the American mission to the United Nations under Mr. Bush. “We will not apologize for thinking America is exceptional; if you read Obama’s Cairo speech, and see what the administration promotes at the United Nations, and look at how we sent the message that we’re resetting our relations with Russia, it’s an admission that we’re apologizing for past policy.”        
 On Afghanistan, where 100,000 American troops remain, the candidates have been all over the map, but have yet to engage seriously with one another on their positions. Mr. Romney offered no specifics on Afghanistan during his speech on Friday, just saying he would “order a full review of our transition to the Afghan military.”        
 Mr. Perry, perhaps the most opaque so far on foreign policy, said during the CNN/Tea Party debate that the United States should continue to have a “presence” in Afghanistan, but that it was time to start turning responsibility for the country over to the Afghans. Mr. Perry has not disclosed who is advising him on foreign affairs and has not given an address on the topic.

 1 2 Next Page »WASHINGTON — A Texas pastor introduced Rick Perry at a major conference of Christian conservatives here on Friday as “a genuine follower of Jesus Christ” and then walked outside and attacked Mitt Romney ’s religion, calling the Mormon Church a cult and stating that Mr. Romney “is not a Christian.”        
 The comments by the pastor, Robert Jeffress of Dallas, injected a potentially explosive issue into the presidential campaign: the belief held by many evangelicals that Mormons are not Christians.        
 And it raised immediate suspicions that the attack might have been a way for surrogates or supporters of Mr. Perry, the Texas governor, who has stumbled in recent weeks, to gain ground by raising religious concerns about Mr. Romney. Mr. Jeffress similarly attacked Mr. Romney and his faith during the 2008 campaign.        
 The Perry campaign sought to put some distance between Mr. Perry and Mr. Jeffress, stating that the governor “does not believe Mormonism is a cult” and that Mr. Jeffress was chosen to speak by the organizers of the event, the Values Voter Summit, which was put on by the Family Research Council, the American Family Association and other evangelical Christian groups.        
 But in a statement, the Family Research Council president, Tony Perkins, said the Perry campaign had approved using Mr. Jeffress to introduce the governor.  “Pastor Jeffress was suggested to us as a possible introductory speaker because he serves as pastor of one of the largest churches in Texas,” Mr. Perkins said. “We sent the request to the Perry campaign which then signed off on the request.”        
 Aides to Mr. Perry did not respond to a number of questions, including whether he  was aware of Mr. Jeffress’s record of calling the Mormon Church a “cult” and denying Mr. Romney’s Christianity; whether he has ever talked with Mr. Jeffress about the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints; and the nature of their relationship.        
 Mr. Perry did not bring up religion on Friday night as he addressed a Republican dinner in Iowa. Asked by a reporter whether he believed the Mormon faith was a cult, Mr. Perry said, “No.” Asked whether he repudiated the remarks of the pastor, he said, “I’ve already answered your question.”        
 A Romney spokesman declined to comment on Mr. Jeffress’s remarks.        
 The depth of the relationship between Mr. Perry and Mr. Jeffress, a Southern Baptist, was unclear, though the governor seemed to indicate some familiarity when he took the stage after being introduced. He called Mr. Jeffress “quite a leader” and noted that he had a church with 10,000 parishioners. He also praised Mr. Jeffress’s introduction, saying he “knocked it out of the park.”        
 Those comments by Mr. Perry were made before Mr. Jeffress attacked Mr. Romney’s religion. In his comments to reporters after his introduction, Mr. Jeffress said he had not discussed Mr. Romney’s religion with Mr. Perry and had no idea what he thinks.        
 Later, Mr. Jeffress said he had been in several meetings with Mr. Perry, including one in which the governor had candidly discussed his own faith. Mr. Jeffress called Mr. Perry an “acquaintance,” but said he had never discussed the Mormon Church with him or his aides. He said he was invited to speak at the conference by Mr. Perkins.        
 Mr. Jeffress, the pastor of the First Baptist Church in downtown Dallas, an influential congregation within the Southern Baptist Convention, also expressed surprise at the stir his comments created, saying that his view of the Mormon Church is widely held by evangelicals. “This isn’t news,” he said. “This idea that Mormonism is a theological cult is not news either. That has been the historical position of Christianity for a long time.”        
 While denying that his comments were coordinated with the Perry campaign, Mr. Jeffress said he emphatically believed that Mr. Romney’s faith would spell trouble for him with many Republican voters and make it hard for him to win in Iowa, as well as South Carolina and other Bible Belt states.        
 “I think it is going to be a major factor among evangelical voters,” he said. “The thing is, they won’t be honest and tell you that it is going to be a major factor. Most people don’t want to admit — even evangelical Christians — that they have a problem with Mormonism. They think it is bigoted to say so. But what voters say to a pollster sometimes is different than what they do when they go into the privacy of a voting booth.”        
 He also said that he believed Mr. Romney is a “good, moral person,” and that he would endorse him over the president.         
 If it comes to that, he said,  “I’m going to instruct, I’m going to advise people that it is much better to vote for a non-Christian who embraces biblical values than to vote for a professing Christian like Barack Obama who embraces un-biblical values.”        
 Now, all eyes turn to Mr. Romney, who is scheduled to speak Saturday at the conference, just before Bryan Fischer, director of issue analysis for government and public policy at the American Family Association. Mr. Fischer is known for his strident remarks on homosexuality, gay rights, Muslims and Mormons.

He called Mr. Jeffress “quite a leader” and noted that he had a church with 10,000 parishioners. He also praised Mr. Jeffress’s introduction, saying he “knocked it out of the park.”        
 Those comments by Mr. Perry were made before Mr. Jeffress attacked Mr. Romney’s religion. In his comments to reporters after his introduction, Mr. Jeffress said he had not discussed Mr. Romney’s religion with Mr. Perry and had no idea what he thinks.        
 Later, Mr. Jeffress said he had been in several meetings with Mr. Perry, including one in which the governor had candidly discussed his own faith. Mr. Jeffress called Mr. Perry an “acquaintance,” but said he had never discussed the Mormon Church with him or his aides. He said he was invited to speak at the conference by Mr. Perkins.        
 Mr. Jeffress, the pastor of the First Baptist Church in downtown Dallas, an influential congregation within the Southern Baptist Convention, also expressed surprise at the stir his comments created, saying that his view of the Mormon Church is widely held by evangelicals. “This isn’t news,” he said. “This idea that Mormonism is a theological cult is not news either. That has been the historical position of Christianity for a long time.”        
 While denying that his comments were coordinated with the Perry campaign, Mr. Jeffress said he emphatically believed that Mr. Romney’s faith would spell trouble for him with many Republican voters and make it hard for him to win in Iowa, as well as South Carolina and other Bible Belt states.        
 “I think it is going to be a major factor among evangelical voters,” he said. “The thing is, they won’t be honest and tell you that it is going to be a major factor. Most people don’t want to admit — even evangelical Christians — that they have a problem with Mormonism. They think it is bigoted to say so. But what voters say to a pollster sometimes is different than what they do when they go into the privacy of a voting booth.”        
 He also said that he believed Mr. Romney is a “good, moral person,” and that he would endorse him over the president.         
 If it comes to that, he said,  “I’m going to instruct, I’m going to advise people that it is much better to vote for a non-Christian who embraces biblical values than to vote for a professing Christian like Barack Obama who embraces un-biblical values.”        
 Now, all eyes turn to Mr. Romney, who is scheduled to speak Saturday at the conference, just before Bryan Fischer, director of issue analysis for government and public policy at the American Family Association. Mr. Fischer is known for his strident remarks on homosexuality, gay rights, Muslims and Mormons.

Even in Iowa, King Corn is not all that it used to be. But can it still make a presidential candidate waffle?        
 Few major presidential aspirants have declared themselves an enemy of corn-based ethanol quite like Gov. Rick Perry of Texas. Three years ago, he unsuccessfully tried to bulldoze a federal law that, in effect, forces billions of bushels of corn to be converted into ethanol and added to gasoline. He argued that this law forced up the price of corn used to feed cattle and chicken, adversely affecting Texas livestock producers. These included powerful campaign donors like the East Texas chicken tycoon Lonnie Pilgrim, who had pressured Mr. Perry to fight the mandate.        
 In Governor Perry’s then-unambiguous view, the federal law has done “significant harm” to American households. “Any government mandate that artificially props up a single industry to the detriment of millions of Americans is bad public policy,” he said.        
 But when Mr. Perry, as a Republican presidential candidate, was asked about the ethanol mandate at an Iowa Corn Growers Association meeting in late August, he ducked the issue and would not answer questions. His evasiveness did not sit well with farmers , but the association’s chief lobbyist, Mindy Larsen Poldberg, was somewhat encouraged.        
 “He didn’t say, ‘No, I don’t support it,’ or ‘Yes, I would support it,’ ” she said. “I wouldn’t say that right now he is against ethanol.”        
 It remains unclear whether Mr. Perry still opposes the ethanol mandate and was merely avoiding a politically awkward issue, or whether he might have been carving out room to change his position.        
 Either way, his sudden public equivocation after years of opposition suggests that ethanol retains not just potency as an issue in Iowa’s presidential caucuses, but also its power to distort national energy policy, which derives from the state’s crucial first-in-the-nation voting and the vastly disproportionate weight and attention presidential candidates give its voters.        
 The caucuses are shaping up as particularly crucial for Mr. Perry, who was trailing far behind Mitt Romney in polls in New Hampshire, the other early-voting state, even before coming under fire in the last debate over issues like immigration . He arrived in Iowa on Friday and is to campaign there on Saturday.        
 Some other candidates have also opposed policies promoting ethanol, and even a spokeswoman for Mr. Romney, who supports “the subsidy of ethanol,” declined to say whether he supported the mandate — a different issue altogether from ethanol’s major subsidy, which is slated to expire soon anyway.        
 But for Mr. Perry and other candidates who have criticized ethanol subsidies there is also a silver lining: The issue may not have the full political force it once did, when opposition was equated with political suicide. After Jon M. Huntsman Jr., a former Utah governor, announced in June that he would not compete in Iowa, saying his ethanol opposition meant he could never do well there, a survey by the Iowa pollster J. Ann Selzer suggested that he might have given up too soon.        
 Only 14 percent of likely Republican and independent caucus voters, she found, described a candidate’s opposition to subsidies as a “deal-killer.” Three out of four said either that it would be “no real problem” or that it was something they would consider among other factors.        
 Iowa’s economy is now centered more on health insurers, banks and other industries than corn, Ms. Selzer said, despite the boom in farm incomes and cropland values. And many caucus voters have soured on government subsidies, which are seen as fiscally unsound, even those that benefit neighbors.        
 “Subsidies are a dirty word with a lot of conservative Republicans,” she said. “It’s the politicians who don’t seem to understand the role of ethanol in Iowa.”        
 As the politics have changed, so, too, has the industry, up to a point. When Tim Pawlenty, then a candidate, announced his opposition to ethanol subsidies in May, he won plaudits for what was called a courageous stand. But industry officials say Mr. Pawlenty, a former Minnesota governor, was not saying anything much different from an industry-backed compromise that had already been hashed out by one of ethanol’s most powerful supporters in Washington, Senator Charles E. Grassley, an Iowa Republican.        
 Until recently, the industry had zealously protected two federal government perks: a 45-cent federal tax credit for every gallon of ethanol blended into gasoline, and a tariff of 54 cents a gallon aimed at Brazilian sugar cane-based ethanol. But recession and deficits wore away political support, and both are set to expire at the end of the year.        
 What the industry still has, though, is far more valuable: the federal mandate that, this year alone, will effectively require almost 40 percent of American corn to be used to make ethanol for gasoline.        
 It is this law — the one Mr. Perry, at least until recently, excoriated — that “is now clearly the bedrock issue” for the ethanol industry, said Monte Shaw, executive director of the Iowa Renewable Fuels Association. Ethanol opponents also have this mandate in their sights, and have filed legislation to either eliminate it or suspend it when supplies of corn are running low.        
 The main reason to get rid of it, they say, is that it drives up food costs, and they cite the tripling of corn prices over the last half-dozen years.        
 One expert, C. Ford Runge, a professor of applied economics at the University of Minnesota, estimated that ethanol accounted for at least 25 percent of the rise in corn prices. In the current environment, the ethanol industry needs the mandate, if not the tax credit and tariff, he said.        
 “Without any of these supports,” Mr. Runge said, “the industry would die a rapid death.”

As the Occupy Wall Street protests spread from Lower Manhattan to Washington and other cities, the chattering classes keep complaining that the marchers lack a clear message and specific policy prescriptions. The message — and the solutions — should be obvious to anyone who has been paying attention since the economy went into a recession that continues to sock the middle class while the rich have recovered and prospered. The problem is that no one in Washington has been listening.        
 At this point, protest is the message: income inequality is grinding down that middle class, increasing the ranks of the poor, and threatening to create a permanent underclass of able, willing but jobless people. On one level, the protesters, most of them young, are giving voice to a generation of lost opportunity.        
 The jobless rate for college graduates under age 25 has averaged 9.6 percent over the past year; for young high school graduates, the average is 21.6 percent. Those figures do not reflect graduates who are working but in low-paying jobs that do not even require diplomas. Such poor prospects in the early years of a career portend a lifetime of diminished prospects and lower earnings — the very definition of downward mobility.        
 The protests, though, are more than a youth uprising. The protesters’ own problems are only one illustration of the ways in which the economy is not working for most Americans. They are exactly right when they say that the financial sector, with regulators and elected officials in collusion, inflated and profited from a credit bubble that burst, costing millions of Americans their jobs, incomes, savings and home equity. As the bad times have endured, Americans have also lost their belief in redress and recovery.        
 The initial outrage has been compounded by bailouts and by elected officials’ hunger for campaign cash from Wall Street, a toxic combination that has reaffirmed the economic and political power of banks and bankers, while ordinary Americans suffer.        
 Extreme inequality is the hallmark of a dysfunctional economy, dominated by a financial sector that is driven as much by speculation, gouging and government backing as by productive investment.        
 When the protesters say they represent 99 percent of Americans, they are referring to the concentration of income in today’s deeply unequal society. Before the recession, the share of income held by those in the top 1 percent of households was 23.5 percent, the highest since 1928 and more than double the 10 percent level of the late 1970s.        
 That share declined slightly as financial markets tanked in 2008, and updated data is not yet available, but inequality has almost certainly resurged. In the last few years, for instance, corporate profits (which flow largely to the wealthy) have reached their highest level as a share of the economy since 1950, while worker pay as a share of the economy is at its lowest point since the mid-1950s.        
 Income gains at the top would not be as worrisome as they are if the middle class and the poor were also gaining. But working-age households saw their real income decline in the first decade of this century. The recession and its aftermath have only accelerated the decline.        
 Research shows that such extreme inequality correlates to a host of ills , including lower levels of educational attainment , poorer health and less public investment. It also skews political power , because policy almost invariably reflects the views of upper-income Americans versus those of lower-income Americans.        
 No wonder then that Occupy Wall Street has become a magnet for discontent. There are plenty of policy goals to address the grievances of the protesters — including lasting foreclosure relief, a financial transactions tax, greater legal protection for workers’ rights, and more progressive taxation. The country needs a shift in the emphasis of public policy from protecting the banks to fostering full employment, including public spending for job creation and development of a strong, long-term strategy to increase domestic manufacturing.        
 It is not the job of the protesters to draft legislation. That’s the job of the nation’s leaders, and if they had been doing it all along there might not be a need for these marches and rallies. Because they have not, the public airing of grievances is a legitimate and important end in itself. It is also the first line of defense against a return to the Wall Street ways that plunged the nation into an economic crisis from which it has yet to emerge.
